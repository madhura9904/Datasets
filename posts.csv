The way suicidal thoughts intertwine with every day life. I decided that hanging was a solid option so went on Amazon to grab some rope, just to have at home. I feel better knowing I have outs when I need them. Figured while I was there I’d grab the electrolytes and protein cookies I’ve been using recently in a quest to eat better.

When I went to my cart to check the price it struck me how silly it looked together. Buying things I’ve been using to better myself and something I might use to end myself at the same time.

I’m curious to hear about your experiences with this.",07-09-2025 20:25,1229,133

Even if someone choose you for a bit, they'd only gonna use you to serve some hidden purpose while they fulfill their true intentions.

Nobody will ever prioritise you, nobody gonna choose you and nobody gonna keep choosing you no matter what happens. Nobody gonna stay. Those are just attractive people's privilege. 

If you are ugly you are forced to just be a bystander while watching all the attractive person truly living, not just surviving or watching on the sidelines like you.

I skipped school today. My school year started literally yesterday, so today was the first day of school. But you know, depression and autism. 

Today was supposed to be one of those days where she would also work her second job, so I came to the conclusion that she'd be back by 3/4 pm as usual. Oh was I wrong.

She came back literally an hour ago because the boss of her second job decided that it's too hot today to work. At this point I had already poured the aspirin into water. It was a painkiller and it was a powder that was in a sachet each had about 500 mg of aspirin and some other stuff but that was what I mainly focused on. I had 10 of them, so 5g or 5000 mg of aspirin which is about half of what I'd need to seriously poison myself with my body weight, but I seriously just wanted to end it, so my desperation completely skipped over the fact that I won't die. I drink it, and she comes home literally 10 minutes later. 

I try to quickly hide all of the aspirin packets, but I wasn't quick enough and she saw. 

She yelled. A lot. Because how dare I have mental health issues when I have a roof over my head, you know all of that bullshit you've probably heard it. 

I had very strong abdominal pain and nausea, I didn't vomit but I felt it coming. I could barely sit in place it was so painful. And I feel guilty as fuck for skipping school and for trying to kill myself, but I still don't want to be here.

Now the pain is very mild and I don't feel nauseous anymore, but I have like an acidic after taste when I swallow and my eyes feel heavy, but I feel fine unfortunately.

For six months I had a severe depression: emptiness, no energy, everything felt meaningless. It was the darkest stretch of my life. Now it feels lighter. The path was uneven with setbacks, but the fog slowly lifted and I can feel the taste of simple things again. I am genuinely grateful for that period. It taught me to hear myself, ask for help, set boundaries, and protect the basics: sleep, food, movement, warm connections. I know I do not want to go back and I am making a promise to keep caring for myself with steady attention. I am posting this because maybe someone needs to see this side too. Things can change.

My family is supportive encouraged me to be social and supported me every single way. I lived in nice neighborhoods where I rarely think of crimes. I have never been bullied nor have I been physical or sexually assaulted. I am in perfect health and never had any serious injuries or chronic illnesses.

Give this opportunity to almost anyone and they would have been wildly successful. Me? I just mess up everything. I'm scared of doing everything and have to be proded to doing any action like a shy little kid only I'm 29. I constantly fantasy about what I could have but I refuse to take any meaningful steps. Everytime I try something different, my mind gets hazy and my stomach churns. 

I work at a deadend job, live with my parents and haven't had a friend since I was 16. I'm ashame to have depression because it's self-inflicted. Had I been born in a broken household, I wouldn't have survived this long.

Loneliness never seems to give me a break. It’s really difficult seeing everyone together with friends and partners or hearing about things people are doing with their friends. Knowing there’s nobody that wants to do anything with you. 
There’s nobody to invite me out to dinner, nobody to have a sleepover with, nobody to talk to, nobody to call. 
I cling to fictional characters but I know they’ll never be real. They’ll never hold me or comfort me outside of my own mind. 
I cried today. I curled up and sobbed like I used to do when I was little. What else can I do?
I can’t tell people to stop talking about their social lives. They’re normal people doing normal things. but it just reminds me of everything I don’t have, everyone I’ve lost, all the times I’ve been thrown away or forgotten.

She had a super busy week at her high earning job and prestigious post grad program. I had a boring week working part time at weird hours and procrastinating law school application stuff. I was hyper fixating on learning a language and plucking my leg hairs while zoomed in super close on my iphone camera this week. Not so proud of the leg hair thing, but It gave me a lot of joy to study the language, but I know i probably spent more time than I should have on it. 

Then, out of nowhere, the energy shifts and I can FEEL the anxiety and emotion in the room. Like i literally felt my whole body tense. She said that she couldn’t be with someone who hyperfixates on random stuff and “does nothing all week.” She said, “I can’t do this anymore,” and told me that my stagnation frustrates her and makes her anxious. She said, “I’ve done so much in the two years since we met, and you’re in the same place living in your parents’ house, not moving forward, not taking steps.” She basically listed out the things that i am the most insecure about, want to change the most, and feel the most awful about.

I genuinely dont think she was trying to be malicious, she’s not the cocky type at all, … i think she was being honest and at a breaking point which almost makes it worse. 
I’m less hurt about the breakup itself (i think we are incompatible unfortunately) than I am about what she said. 

She’s right. She’s booked and busy. She has her own apartment, lots of friends, multiple degrees, a thriving career. I’m in my parent’s basement, basically friendless, and my room is terminally messy. 

It also hurt because i feel so unseen by her. Like she doesnt see the progress i have made in the past couple years, that ive applied to law school (reapplying now) and got a 94th percentile score on the LSAT. Tho its small compared to her and what shes been doing. I just hate myself because i want to go fast and feel alive and not depressed and stuck in adhd traps but … idk maube its impossible. 

It feels so hard to pick myself up at this point. I’ve been so stuck for so long. When it comes to career stuff, It feels like my ex is metaphorically on an escalator while i am clawing my way out of a ditch. And she refuses to see that. Idk. I just feel less than. 

How do i cope with being broken up with for being a loser when it’s kinda true?

Countless missed opportunities, runied relationships...

I've been on antidepressants for 7 years, I don't know if it helps anymore... My depressive episodes are more frequent and last longer and longer. I can't go to work. I can't be a partner. I'm just in this vegetative state.

I know I can't end it because it would ruin my loved ones, so I'm holding on. But it's a miserable existence. The guilt is eating me because there are people who actually have real problems, all the wars, famine, violence. I have to be grateful I know that. But I feel nothing . I feel nothing.. Just numb.

To give you some backstory, I’m 14F, he is 47M. He would always snap at me when I was a kid and gets mad super easily. I’ve always been scared of what he might do to me.

I was severely depressed from age 13 to around 23. Hospitalized twice after suicide attempts. Barely graduated high school (with an IEP). Took forever to finish college (just now graduated with a BA in psychology in May). Got accepted into a master’s program that I’m not going to enroll in (don’t have the time, don’t have the motivation, need to work full-time to avoid homelessness).

My only work experience has been retail and fast food. I can’t get anything else. It’s all I’m good for. I can’t believe I was delusional enough to think getting a degree and going to therapy would improve my life. There’s no point in getting a master’s; who the fuck would hire someone with a master’s degree and only retail and fast food work experience??? 

The truth is that I ruined my life by not doing more when I was younger. Not joining organizations in college, not networking, not choosing a different major. I spent years wanting to die, wasting away in bed. It fucking ruined my life. Now, at 26, when the fog finally lifted enough that I could imagine a future for myself, I’m realizing that it’s too late. 

Back then, when I was in the hospital, people told me that it wasn’t the end. That there was a beautiful life ahead of me. That I was still young and I hadn’t ruined my life. It wasn’t true.

I’m a pathetic loser. That’s all I’ll ever be. I’m ashamed of my life.",03-09-2025 21:09,110,18

I've already taken several different medications and had a routine to reduce the symptoms, but this time nothing can make me want to move, or be encouraged. I don't recognize myself anymore, sometimes I feel like I've lost my personality. 

I lost my mother, got divorced and have been in bad relationships for the last 4 years.
Currently I have entered a depressive cycle that I cannot escape due to psychological and external factors that are independent of me. I currently don't have any partner, my professional life is gone because of my emotional instability and financially I'm declining.

I want to stay in bed all day, I don't care about the world ending outside, I just want to go into a deep sleep and wake up well, so sometimes I take medicine and sleep for a whole day, or I end up drinking alcohol. 

I don't want to die, but because I'm so apathetic about everything, I want to end it all, every day I think about it. 

My family loves me, but because they've seen me deal with everything so well all these years and because of the emotional instability that makes me have productive days and less depressed, it seems like they're used to seeing me like this, but in reality I can't take it anymore.

While I have never made a suicide attempt, missed a day's work, or been hospitalized, I still have had profound depression and anxiety that centers on my job and the need to work.  For various reasons, a reduction in hours or a complete career change were never feasible but I feel that if I could retire tomorrow with the means to modestly sustain myself, my depression would completely fly away.  With that said, the trend I see in looking back on my life, is the many job changes and physical moves that I have had-across town, to a different city, across the country....it's pretty crazy!   I think it's a combination of several factors but mostly chronic boredom and the constant, albeit, elusive search for happiness or something better.  Another thing, is that outside of my childhood/teenage years, I have had zero friends.  Don't get me wrong, I have been well-liked at my jobs, am married (no kids) and am not a hermit, but see myself as a bit of a misanthrope as well as being extremely introverted.

What now??","I’m 30 years (F) old and currently preparing PhD applications. This process is already overwhelming. A few months ago, I went through a sudden breakup with my long-distance partner. Right before that, I shared something I had kept to myself for years: someone very close to him had sexually harassed me in the past.

He was supportive at first. He said, “We’ll get through this together.” He wanted to know more. Eventually, I told him the name.
And then his entire tone changed. He withdrew. A few days later, he told me:

“Wow, you hid this for years. Congratulations.”
Then:
“I can’t help you.”
And finally:
“I don’t want to see you.”



After that, I collapsed. Emotionally, psychologically.
I reached out to two close friends.



The first friend is doing her PhD abroad. She’s engaged, but for years had been emotionally involved in a platonic connection with someone else.
My breakup happened nearly 5 months ago, and ever since then, almost every conversation we had focused on her grief over losing that connection.
While I was still reeling from opening up about a traumatic event and grieving my relationship, she spent over 90 minutes telling me about her own story, her therapy, her reflections.
I just wanted to be heard.

I didn’t say “I’m suicidal” outright. But I said I felt numb. Empty. Like nothing mattered anymore.
After the call, she messaged me:

“Drink water. Why did you blame yourself? I guess we trauma dumped. I thought talking about my problems might help you.”

That text shattered me. It was clear she never heard me. That even in my collapse, she remained centered in her own emotional process.

The second friend is a psychologist.

I told her directly that I was having suicidal thoughts. I was honest and careful in my words. I said:

“What I’ve experienced has left me traumatized. I’m struggling to trust people. You don’t have to support me if you don’t want to—but I do need help. This isn’t manipulation. I’m telling you this sincerely.”

She said she understood.
Then she sent me a voice message saying:

“You’re like a wounded dog. An emotional dog. A hurt little dog.”
.”

The next morning, she messaged me:

“Good morning, emotional dog.”

That same day, in the evening, I reached out again. I needed to talk. I was unraveling. The coldness from my ex, and the dismissal from my other friend, had pushed me into a very dark place.
This friend had said earlier she was free all day. But suddenly she said she was going to a concert.

I told her this was serious. That I felt awful.
She said:

“The world doesn’t revolve around your schedule.”

I tried again:

“You have a friend who’s falling apart. Can’t you speak differently to someone like that?”
She replied:
“Okay. Do what you want.”

I then told her, more directly, that I didn’t want her support anymore—but that I was feeling dangerously suicidal. Her final response:

“Do whatever you want, okey dont worry. Let me know if you need anything.”




I no longer speak to either of these two people.

I spoke about sexual trauma, grief, and suicidal despair. And in return, I was either ignored, centered around, or minimized. Maybe they are rigth 



Now here’s where I’m at:

I’m in therapy//even İ am psychologist too but I’ve completely lost my ability to trust—even in therapy.
Even with my therapist. I don’t trust anyone anymore.

And I need to ask:
Has anyone else ever felt this? Truly?

Because right now, I don’t feel like a person anymore.
Not someone in the world.
I feel like the most unwanted, abandoned, and invisible form of life in the entire universe.

It's more devastating looking on how hard I work and try to be good for everything. To the point I have a chronic illness, and all sort of health problem. I broke my body and of course mentally just trying to get a little of comfort. None of that is working. 
I no longer have family or friends, people I love passed a long time ago and I have always been alone for 17 years. 
I have only been in two long term relationships in my 38 years of life, i got married once and my husband hated me with all of his heart. Eventually they left me for another people. Same thing happened with my first ex, cheated and left me for another person. Everyone never choose me, I am always there gave them all of me when everyone needs me, but once I need them they left. Everyone left me behind even if I beg cause I really need them, they still left me. 

Everything has to be hard for me. It's like I was born and set to do life at nightmare mode ++ that I didn't even consent to be put in. 
Meanwhile looking at everyone around me especially if I go to a mall everyone always has someone. Nobody is ever alone. For other people it's easy to have someone and that someone always choose them and no one else. Meanwhile it took me 8 years to find someone again after my first ex and it's so easy for them to replace me. And then they live happily ever after too meanwhile I was thrown into the trash and back to isolation. 

I'm so exhausted I don't even try anymore these days. All I do is wake up, work on my desk, then go back to sleep. I sleep like 12hrs+ these days cause bed pillows and blanket is the only thing I have that close to comfort/feeling protected. Eating used to still feel good and I looked forward to eat while watching shows. Not anymore. I don't even eat. If I eat it would be instant ramen. 

I want everything to be over. Let me rest. I think it's gonna be soon. My step brother's friend died in his sleep cause of tremendous stress. 
Ever since my husband left me for another woman and asking divorce I woke up with my heart beating so fast and hard, head ringing everyday, stomach issues, body trembling and sometimes I cry all day to the point my legs and my lower back are too weak to walk around the house. My depression has gone to another level. And it's good. Died in my sleep is the best outcome for me. After such a cruel and hard life at least I deserve such a peaceful way out of this hellhole. 

If I die at least I can meet my mom again. ",20-08-2025 10:19,54,10

depression,1muw5pm,deleted,deleted,My life as a trans person just got worse,"I'm 27 (mtf), I came out 2 years ago as soon as I figured it out because I knew my family (my parents and sister) would always support me. They were one of the most liberal people you'd ever meet. They raised me to always be comfortable with whatever I identify as and encouraged me to tell them. And I was right, they did support me. Everything was going perfect until 7 months ago. My sister got married and her and her husband practically started living with us because my parents' house is big and they wanted us kids to stay with them while earning our own money. We happily wanted that too. I'm not so sure anymore tho. My sister's husband is from a conservative family but he was supporting at first. Just that he didn't ever say anything bad and treated me nice, mostly indifferent which I thought was good. Slowly for these last 7 months that he's been living with us, he has almost completely turned my parents and sister conservative. It sounds fucking crazy and it is. With the given political environment it's already depressing enough to be trans now my parents have started asking questions like ""are you sure about still transitioning?"" ""It's not too late to turn back"". They are also convinced that attending church every week will help me ""understand things better"". I wasn't prepared mentally so I didn't start my transition until a year ago. I've made good progress but I've been taking it slow so yes it does look like I can ""turn back"" and live ""normally"". This entire thing has crushed me inside. I want to vent each incident and how this slowly unfolded but I don't even have the energy to type anymore. I'm broken right now. I'm planning to move out and it's scary especially being alone in this political environment. I'm not even that financially stable. I don't have many friends to support me. I'm so fucking tired.

I enjoy nothing.,"I am a person who loses interest very quick. Ever since I was a child, I would immerse myself into something, and after few days/weeks/months, i would get bored and just stop doing it. Well that allowed me to explore many things for a short while. But I guess I never developed a true hobby.

In fact, I lost my interest from my degree too, the one that I chose with so much passion. It's like nothing really makes me happy. Well they do while I immerse myself. But then one morning I wake up and realise that it is not fun anymore. This has hugely impacted my life. I can't stick to one thing. Also, I have changed my cities, countries, and home quiet a lot ever since i was a kid (due to parents job). Now i can't even stay at one place for too long, and must keep changing,

I know I need to go out there and meet people, be courageous to start something on my own. But I am too scared. I want help, but idk who will. People Around me don't get me. talking to professionals require money.

I keep coming with so many ideas to to fix my life but i am too scared to do any of it, I am scared to interact, initiate, and scared of failure. It may sound like I am making an excuse, or i am being lazy. But honestly, only I know how difficult it is. I just try to avoid everything. I am just trying to take shelter. but it can't keep going like this forever.

I have had depression and anxiety for more than 5 years now. I was always an introvert. I think my social anxiety triggered after the pandemic. I have started medication this year though. After that my depression has improved a little. But social anxiety, fear of doing something is still there. idk what to do.",12-09-2025 15:27,44,7

That moment when you realize things aren’t going to be fine, and you keep finding yourself falling into the same pit again and again. The desire for everything to just end only grows stronger. And as you get older, you start to see how everything unravels, no matter how much effort you’ve put in. That realization breaks you even more. Life keeps getting harder with age. More responsibilities, more weight to carry, and you have to use all your energy just to hold yourself together. Eventually, you stop dreaming about the future. You tell yourself to stop having dreams at all.

And the worst thing is, nobody really cares. The society that’s supposed to guide you, support you, and keep you on the right track, it’s all a lie. Everyone else has their own struggles, their own demons, their own survival to worry about. There’s nobody left to pull you up when you’re drowning. And I can't really blame them.

You start to see how easy it is to slip through the cracks. How quickly people forget about you once you stop being useful to them. You could be screaming inside, and the world just keeps moving, pretending it doesn’t hear. That’s the cruelest part. Not the pain itself, but the silence that surrounds it. It's hell on earth.

I know they won’t be sad when I die anyways they have my brother who’s got more potential than I ever had. God I can’t fucking wait to die. I’d love to be around to see how they’d react haha but whatever imagining it is satisfying enough 

I hate parents.

Depression (also called major depression, major depressive disorder, clinical depression) is different. It can cause serious symptoms that affect how a person feels, thinks, and coordinates daily activities such as sleeping, eating, or working.

Depression can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, race or ethnicity, income, culture, or educational level. Research suggests that genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors play a role in depression.

Women are diagnosed with depression more often than men, but men can feel depressed too. Because men are less likely to recognize, talk about, and seek help to cope with their negative feelings, they are at greater risk of having their depression symptoms go undiagnosed and undertreated.",21-08-2025 12:44,44,16

I talked to a girl for 6 months playing games and talking all the time. We stalled planning a date because we both have panic disorders and it would be a lot of anxiety. We eventually go on a date that she kind of pressured into happening. It went really well and I hugged her goodbye and she blushed neon red. We go home and play gears of war online afterwards and it was all really sweet. After the date she paints he nails my favorite color and we talk about when we can meet again. Then one night she asks if I like nudes, I say yeah but it takes a bit for me to be comfy to send but I am feeling that with her. She doesn't ask if she can but she sends me nudes while at a bar. We flirt for awhile and I feel like I need to reciprocate and after the date being pressured I still felt some pressure. I'm super responsive to what she sends but she was minimally responsive to mine. Still positive but it felt off. The next day or so she needed space and I asked if she was pulling away and she said she wasn't. We make plans to meet up later in the week. But after that convo she initiates a break up conversation. I tell her that I understand and it's okay but I'm a little uncomfortable and hurt with the timing being right after the nudes. We had a talked weeks previously about me having trauma induced insecurities about my body. And all I asked for was honesty or reassurance. In response to me saying I'm uncomfortable she told me ""it happens all the time get over it. Stop blowing up my phone telling me how shitty I am"". This absolutely broke me. She had said before she never wanted to make me uncomfortable. And was always extremely kind towards me so this was a complete flip. I exited that conversation but reiterated the next day that I don't think I deserved that and she blocked me. That sent me over the edge and I lashed out saying I hated her among other things. She used that lash out to blame me for the whole relationship failing and told me I needed a therapist not a girlfriend. I've been in therapy for 5 years working on these traumas and healing. I spent a lot of time learning how to communicate and I feel like it completely blew up in my face. It's worse because this was like a dream girl for me.

Never had many meaningful friendships or relationships. I have had several long term relationships and a few very close friends but they all amounted to pretty much nothing. For a few years this really upset me. So much so I would alter my personality or think there was something inherently wrong with me to try and keep people around. 

After a few years of just genuinely being alone it feels like a weight has been lifted. I can enjoy my own company and don’t rely on others for happiness or contentment. But this change in my attitude that has set in has also come with an incredible disliking for most people. This deep feeling of dislike isn’t something I want. I don’t want to dislike people. In fact I think my life would benefit from more meaningful relationships. Idk if it’s a trauma response or a defense mechanism but I genuinely don’t trust and generally dislike most people. If I can sense they like me and are outward about it I might change my opinion about that person. But generally I find that most people dislike me and I’d be a fool to try and be kind to them or interact with them in a way that doesn’t assert my own value. 
Basically for the last couple years every interaction with someone makes me feel like shit about myself. Obviously the common denominator is ME. But why do I keep perceiving negativity from others? It’s not fake. I’m not schizophrenic I can clearly sense and feel the judgement and negativity coming from people but rather than try and win people over I’m too tired to even try anymore. I just don’t care about you enough to even want to get to know if you’d be a good friend worth investing in because I feel this fatigue of negative interactions ",18-08-2025 02:01,39,9

It just feels like the world completely abandoned me to work myself to death and has done nothing but punish me whenever I rattle my chains. I just have nothing to keep me going. No hope, no proof, not anything that anyone would ever like me. It is just an endless procession of people telling me to look else where. 

I really just want to die at this point. What alternatives do I have. ",03-09-2025 16:15,36,4

I need to share something honestly and I hope I won’t be judged. I recently noticed bedsores forming in my sacral area. I’ve spent many years mostly lying in bed for hours every day, being very sedentary. I’m very thin and tall. The main reason for this is that I’ve been struggling with depression for many years, which makes it extremely hard to get up and move around.

I’m autistic, I don’t work outside the home, and I’m a stay-at-home mom. My husband helps provide for me and our daughters, so I’ve mostly stayed in the house and in bed.

I’m only 38, and I’m shocked to see this happening to my body. I know this is unhealthy, and I feel scared and overwhelmed by it. I’m sharing this here because I need to be honest about what’s going on with me.

Please, I ask for understanding rather than judgment.",01-09-2025 04:18,35,19

22F, lifelong history of trauma. I could never fully expound on the details of my life in a single post, but needless to say it’s been bad. My dad abandoned me, I got severely bullied at school and in my community, I have previous sexual trauma from grooming…. a lot has happened. My mom and I had to move in with my grandparents when I was a kid and it never felt natural to me. Negativity is all I’ve known. It’s fully ingrained into my being, but now the rape is just too much. It’s absolutely too much. 

I was raped by someone I knew over 7 months ago now, during my final semester of college. He did it while I was asleep, after we had consensual sex. I invited him over shortly after having a health scare because I needed a friend. I guess he waited until I was fully asleep to do it. He smothered me and held me down after I woke up during it. He cleaned me up when he was done. I never saw him again after the incident because he gaslit me so much. He said I started it. There’s absolutely no way I did. I put myself in that situation but I did not start anything. I’ve not spoken to him since and he’s kind of gone into hiding. 

The aftermath of the incident was a disaster. I tried confiding in people who I thought were on my side, and they used my trauma to bully me. They didn’t personally know my rapist but I fully believe they would take his side if they did. My family hasn’t been much help either. My very religious grandmother tells me it happened because I wasn’t living for god. She said that god could have prevented it and saved me if I was blessing him. It’s so depressing. 

Time is passing too quickly. I reported the guy who did this to me last week. I finally did it. I’m still so numb, upset, angry…. a lot of different things. What I do know is that I don’t remember the last time I’ve truly been happy. I’m moving out of the country in a few days for grad school and I don’t feel ready. I don’t see the point of anything anymore. Sometimes I’m excited about my new adventure but other times I feel so trapped and hopeless. I feel a big breakdown coming. It’s like my brain doesn’t want me to cry. I wish it would. 

I’ve never felt this apathetic before, and I don’t know how to move on. Everyone tells me to take things one step at a time, but I don’t see the point. I don’t know how to take care of myself or see the joy in anything anymore. If my dad leaving me broke my heart, my rape stole it. I don’t have a heart anymore. ",09-09-2025 23:01,35,7

We're both suicidal but he's significantly worse than me and has attempted multiple times before. I know what depression is like and I know that it makes you feel hopeless and so maybe this isn't exactly the best place to ask but idk. Since I'm older, he asked me to buy him some pills so he can OD even if he never explicitly said that was what they were for. 

I love him more than anyone else and he's probably the only person I can confidently say that about. I care about him a lot but our parents suck, especially our father who was abusive (again more to him than me) but we don't live with him anymore. From the way he talks about it, it genuinely seems like he would be better off dead. 

Our mother constantly invalidates his issues or compares them in a way because I'm autistic and that's permanent whereas he's depressed and that's something you can actually recover from. But she doesn't know half of it and I know there's plenty he hasn't told me too. Neither of us trusts her in the slightest. 

The trauma that he has is something I could never imagine living with and I honestly believe that he would be happier if he were dead. He's in therapy with CAMHs at the moment but I was with them at one point too and they don't help in the slightest. 

I'm pretty sure it would be illegal for me to get him pills if I knew he was planning to kill himself with them but I could make it look like a coincidence. I know mental hospitals are an option but from what I've heard about them, they're usually more traumatising than anything that gets you put in them.

I may be very near to planning an exit.,"Since I was a child I’ve had mental issues. Once I turned 30 I became full blown alcoholic. I’ve gotten a better grip on alcohol but I still struggle with it. 

Ive self harmed many times. Had a close call with a weapon once. Been locked in mental wards about half a dozen times. I feel like I’m  just so tired of fighting. 

I’ve been on meds for a while. Can’t really afford therapy. When I’ve done therapy it just seems underwhelming. 

I feel my cognitive functions slipping. I’m very forgetful now. Probably from past alcohol abuse and a few concussions I’ve had. 

But yea. Not trying to tell a life story but I feel like I’m done. I have no friends really. No family support. I do have one son who is 11. We have the same name and bday which is cool. I used to have him full time but since Covid he lives w his mom and we trade for holidays. 

I plan on maxing out all my credit cards and buying gold and silver so he can have something when he turns 18. 

But yea. That’s about it. I’m just tired and done. Been feeling this way most of my life and I don’t really see a path for happiness. Hobbies don’t interest me anymore. No friends to do things with. Can’t go out and enjoy an occasional drink like a regular person. 

I have a few diagnosed illnesses but I also think I may have ptsd. Not sure. 

Any ways. Fuck this stupid planet. We’re all fucked anyways. I’d rather pass on my terms.

I'm neurodivergent and kind of annoying to neurotypicals so I think they kind of just faked it to keep the peace. At the beginning of the school year, my uncle, who was like a grandfather to me, passed away and it took a huge toll on my mental health. That on top of living hundreds of miles away from my family was really hard. I  was also subsequently assaulted multiple times by a boy who was in my ""friend group"". When I opened up to my roommates about it, they blatantly told me they did not believe me because they didn't think he would ever do anything like that, he's such a nice guy, whatever. So they told everyone I lied. 

Anyway, fast forward to now, all those friends have stopped talking to me, and one of the girls is living in an apartment with my abuser.

This is my first time being prescribed anti-depressants and I hoped it would help treat my low mood & motivation, trouble focusing and low energy levels despite sleeping 9+ hours every night. 

I also told my doctor about my history of binge eating and concerns about weight gain while on anti-depressants. I’m quite annoyed because he failed to mention that Mirtazapine is strongly associated with increased appetite and weight gain. I struggle with my hunger cues as is and I’m an emotional eater so I’m afraid to start taking it. I assume he prescribed Mirtazapine to help with my quality of sleep but I’m not sure if my low energy is due to poor sleep quality but rather the depression itself. 

I don’t know what to do. Should I go back to my doctor and express my concerns or push through a month of Mirtazapine and see how I go first?",10-09-2025 01:58,24,36

Don't get me wrong, I've definitely been very depressed, but I've never had serious issues with unaliving or anything like that. I don't know at what point in my life it happened, but I sort of just lost interest in everything. At first I developed some serious anxiety, which I still deal with. But this post is about my depression, which I think stems from my anxiety. As I learned more about the world and found out how ugly people can really be, and how politically there are a very few that get to control what happens in the world, I just kind of checked out because of how bad it scared me. It's hard to focus on my mundane tasks like work and hobbies because it feels like they really aren't building up to anything. Why would I want to work up to anything when the planet is getting hotter, new wars are starting every day, the food we eat is poisoned, and there's really just not that much waiting for us at the end? I don't want to live through political and climate disaster, but leaving this life myself is just too scary an option. 

Basically the days are getting shorter. It's getting harder to get out of bed. There is this constant blur from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep. I experience moments of beauty, but it never lasts or leaves me with any sense of hope. I don't know what to do. ",01-09-2025 18:23,22,11

I’ve been on at least 20 different medications over this time, with little improvement from any of them. My current regimen is Concerta 36mg, Wellbutrin 300mg, Zyprexa 5mg, and Klonopin as a prn. The addition of Zyprexa is relatively new, although I’ve taken other antipsychotics before. We started the Zyprexa because I was having mood swings and random crying episodes constantly. I do feel like it’s helped in the sense and I have been feeling more stable emotionally. However, the sleep that this puts me in is too much for a normal lifestyle. I work 12 hour shifts, meaning I only have time for up to 9 hours of sleep (normal). But with the Zyprexa, I now find myself oversleeping, sleeping through alarms going off for hours, increased tardiness at work. Even when I’m awake, there’s intense brain fog. My actions at work are life and death, not to be taken lightly. Im also incredibly dizzy and feel like I’m at sea all the time. I can’t help but feel like there’s no help out there.

I keep hearing that depression and anxiety can shorten someone's life, but i don't see this at all. People who love life and have many reasons to live die young and people who wait for death wait forever.    

It's not fair. I used to live recklessly for many years and never took care of my health, yet at 42 I'm healthier than a lot of the young people out there. In the meantime I also lost my sister to cancer 2 years ago. She really loved life and the people around her and she also helped many people through her whole life. Since then I quit my job and spend my time escaping reality with movies and video games and keeping busy in the house. I can't face life as it is now.   

Every time i hear about someone dying tragically or painfully and young I always wonder, why couldn't it be me? These people had dreams and loved life. I don't have any.   

So why does it seem that we live longer? Do you know anybody with depression or death obsession who died early, but didn't cause it himself? ",09-09-2025 17:19,21,4

As I mentioned, my self-harming behavior is normalized for me, but I was a little taken aback by the way the psychologist expressed himself.

I have virtually no life experiences that you would normally do with a group of friends, as a result I feel like I can’t relate to people. 

I wanted a career change and due to poor mental health I quit my job on impulse and was unemployed for two years. Now I’m making practically minimum wage in a repetitive, mundane job which just makes me feel awful every day as my soul decays with each menial task.

Ignore the pretentious writing style, it makes me feel better.

  
We often speak, when discussing the human condition, about an underlying meaning or purpose to the business of life. We desperately argue for moral cause and ethical duty. We determine value of life by metrics, as if success and happiness can justify existence. More than that, we discuss happiness as if it exists, as if it is more than electricity through flesh. We delude ourselves. We allow ourselves to forget pain and misery, to spread out moments of joy over entire days while burying the overwhelming melancholy. As a species, we are delusional. To survive our miserable existence, we allow ourselves to be drugged by chemicals in our brain. We are fucking idiots. 

Beyond depression, just from a sheer numbers comparison, there is absolutely nothing that could make up for the endless pain of just being alive. We have grown stupidly tolerant, driven by biological desires designed to keep us alive when we did not live in a post survival world. We are blinded by our innate desire to find good in everything and the insistent indoctrination of human importance from everywhere all the time. We do not matter. Everyone will be forgotten and everyone will die, so why do we try so hard? Why do we try at all?

Will someone please, explain the sanctity of life to me. I want to understand the preciousness of human skin. I want to know the ""magic"" hidden in my brain chemistry and behind my heart. I just really, really don't get it.",10-09-2025 00:55,19,3

On my birthday month this year, I met this wonderful girl and swore that I would marry her because she's worth it all. She even made me feel like I could beat this demon called depression. 

One day a bit over a month ago, she disappears for about 4 days to which I go insane thinking that we are doing great. She comes back and lies to me to my face about where she's been (she was with her ex-boyfriend). 
I call her out and all she does is deflect and paint herself as the victim. 
This became a cycle whenever I'd call her out on her bullshit. That was the first time she cheated. The second time, she went to her ex-boyfriends place a couple of days after her birthday. 

Here's the kicker, today, I've found that she had been messaging her ex-boyfriend on WA and chat locked the conversation and muted notifications. 

Now I'm just sitting here, in the dark typing up my story to all of you. I truly wouldn't wish this kind of betrayal upon my worst enemy because right now I really do feel like I can't continue with this feelings. I feel like a shell of myself.

I basically said it all in the title but I have major examinations coming up for school, pre med and i can’t conjure up the the strength to go ahead with it. Which is annoying because I was able to pull 6 hr reps previously.

Now my friends family and teachers all think I’m being lazy and I can’t come up with an excuse as to why I’m being like this. I’m failing everybody around me and myself the most.


It’s been like this for almost a month and it’s starting to affect my academics! I stay in bed all day and somehow not sleeping. Every time I miss an opportunity to do something productive, I feel guilty and self harm. I know if I fail I will consider suicide no joke(edit- I wont go ahead with it I’m religious but I don’t want to be in that mindset), my validation comes from academics.

Also my parents are being really hard on me to do well they don’t know about my depression and I can’t tell them,(for very valid reasons)
there’s so much pressure from school and home and I can’t match up to it, plus I’m dealing with this alone with no support system therefore it’s crucial that I hold myself accountable whenever I get like this because nobody else will. 

My reasonings‼️

Pro me being lazy and using depression as an excuse - I can still get up and do something, I manage to go to the kitchen to grab something to eat but can’t go to my desk and STUDY. I need to have some responsibility.

Against this notion - I also don’t have the energy to do sports that I love such as swimming and self isolate all day,,, if I was lazy I would’ve been selective with the things I enjoy so mabye I’m being hard on myself?

I have spoken to a doctor but in the meantime I don’t want to make excuses for myself,

Everyone tells me to just be happy but I don’t even know where to start ans im just so embarrassed I did this to myself I don’t think I deserve to be happy I’m a complete failure now all in the bane of hope just so that he could tell me he can’t be the man I need and that he’s focusing on making himself a better person and he doesn’t have time for negative people or people who can’t grow with him💔 after he proposed to me back in January and over the course of the years said he was doing his best to make things work.

I ruin anything good for myself, I don't do it on purpose but I can never do anything right. anytime I'm doing well, my stupid weak self gets burnt out and ruins it. I'm tired of trying to do good because I'll always just ruin it eventually.

I don't care about my physical needs I don't care about my health, I absolutely hate myself. I don't care about my future. I tried to care and I just can't, especially when nobody else cares about these things and I have to care all alone. I tried to get emotional support and it made me hate myself more, I'm stupid for thinking they actually care. I tried to treat my anemia and it didn't work the first time so all the energy I had left to care about it is gone.

the only thing I like about myself is how I look, but that doesn't mean shit to me anymore. I wanna be worth more than that. and I'm not. everyone just hates me and I hate myself the most. I'm worthless. this is all so painful because every single day I have to pretend to care. I just wish I were dead but I have to sit here everyday, pretend to feel all these emotions, pretend to have energy and act like I wanna be here.

I'm 19F, I have literally 0 friends, I can't get out of the house much which is awful. I have no job. I have chronic health conditions that are awful. I haven't finished my high school education my motivation is so low. It's kinda like, what's the point? My life's going nowhere. Also, I have severe anxiety (generalized and social) so I can't even make steps to a better life without having a panic attack.

On top of that, I haven't seen my therapist in months. Why you ask? Oh, because she thinks that I've went through a program for extensive group therapy. I haven't! I haven't been! It's stressing me out because I'm thinking I can't make an appointment because she'll be disappointed in me.

My childhood cat had to be put down a while ago, and I'm still mourning, especially because my mom never told me she was for sure dying 3 days before we had to put my cat down. She claims she's been ""failing juggling everything"" and that she's been busy, which she has been, but my god I think telling me our cats dying should take priority over laundry.
Ever since she's passed, I feel so lonely. I never realized just how alone I am/feel until she passed.

I could go on and on, I'm just so bored, and boredom brings bad thoughts.
I'm just so hopeless which is hard to except. I used to be so optimistic, but I'm about to turn 20 and I've literally done nothing with my life. Partially because of my health issues, my family having health issues, and my anxiety.

I don't want to sit here feeling sorry for myself. I know I have potential, I know if I can get over a few things I could actually start living, but I freeze everytime I even think about it.

I don't know what I'm looking for. Advice? Encouragement? I honestly feel like I just need someone to to really push me and tell me to get over it.

I feel sad for my children who have to grow up in this horrible world. I feel guilty for bringing them into the world.

Everything is just so overwhelming. I also deal with a lot of existential depression and dread. I think about suicide often, but have never acted on it, mostly now for my children’s sake.

I also believe I would be happier on my own, where I could be free to do things for myself without the responsibilities of managing a family. But then I don’t know that for sure. Maybe I would be just as a sad on my own. It’s killing me.

I like to escape into music. I have been laying in bed tonight crying to myself while listening to music. My wife is just sleeping like everything is ok.

What i don't get is that i still feel so fucking lonely even though I have a bright future. I'm wanting to go to college and I'm part of a school program that helps with it, I know what I want to be, I have a girlfreind soon to be. But I've also had a lot of shit happen to me before that still messes with me. Don't get me wrong I love my family and wouldn't want to hurt them but I've been hurt so much sometimes I get lost in my own mind even though I remember I have everything under control. And even with my soon to be girlfreind I still am kind of intimidated by love since my ex gaslit and manipulated me into thinking she loved me even though she really didn't. She was the only girlfreind I ever genuinely loved and almost a year later i'm mostly over it but it still comes to strike every now and again when I think about shit. I have no one else except my counselor and a few close family members of mine to talk to about this but this is just a vent. Thanks for reading if you got this far. I would appreciate any feedback ",29-08-2025 21:55,17,5

Sure I may not feel depressed anymore, but thats not going to undo all the damage that 8 years of depression did to my life. I had depression around ages 12-20. Now I'm 21 and I don't feel so bad anymore. But the years of depression completely nuked my life. No friends, no girlfriend, no social skills, completely incapable of being productive, not physically active, no hobbies, no direction in life, no money, no nothing. Now I'm going to an university and I just have no idea how I'll ever manage. ITS SO HARD TO GET BACK ON TRACK. And I feel so fucking inferior to everyone else. And the longer I'm not on track, the easier it feels to fall back into depression. I feel like if I don't manage to break this cycle, its completely gonna consume me again. And if I can't move past depression I'd probably just give up on life. 

Of course I'm not delusional. I know when you've have depression for this long, its never just gonna disappear like poof. I just please please please wanna function and be productive and live my life.",26-08-2025 06:38,15,6
depression,1n0dh8j,deleted,deleted,Everyone just seems so inhuman.,"Everywhere I go, it feels like people are just nasty, petty, or living in a haze.

My kid's school student services director basically told me my kid was not gifted and there's nothing special about him after I've had him tested and gone through years and different school districts holding him back for no good reason. Yes, he passed the tests. Yes, the teachers acknowledged his advanced capacity for learning. But he never received any kind of differentiated instruction. This bureaucrat at this school he's been at for a month has never talked to my son. She knows nothing about him, but she has the gall to act like she knows what he's capable of and didn't even want to listen to me. As long as she checked off the boxes on her forms and followed orders, my son doesn't matter. I got the sense that she enjoyed being able to say no.

But what's the purpose? Isn't education about leading children to learn and strive to be their best selves? So why is it a good thing to be the person who enjoys telling children what they can't do? Even when there's a very good chance they could prove you wrong and trying hurts no one. 

At work, nobody cares if what we produce is a quality product. Nobody cares if it actually works or helps people. Nobody cares if anything of substance is achieved. It's just a bunch of people stumbling around trying to act like they're doing something. As long as it looks good it's good by our C-suite. Any passion or concern about the actual end result of the product gets deprioritized in the face of flash and bang magic shows.

Nobody cares about doing a good job anymore. Nobody cares about the other people depending on that work. Everyone is just trying to grab what they can and screw the rest. The bare minimum. Whatever they can get away with.

I've poured my body and soul into this life to scrape myself up from a penniless nobody to an educated, respected, successful professional. And yet I'm powerless to change anything. I'm not rich enough to start a school and run it the right way. I'm not rich enough to even quit working, retire, homeschool my kids and disappear. 

Everything just feels like it was all for nothing. It's all just bullshit, people stumbling through some sick pantomime of life. I take my meds. I try to occupy myself and be ""happy"". But it just feels like busy work to keep my mind off of how life really is so that I can trick myself into believing I'm happy until I die. 

Therapists and doctors are the same way. They don't care about who I am as a person. I'm a product, a commodity. I'm going to help pay for their next new car. Nobody cares if they say something that will actually help me. As long as they check off the boxes and funnel me into the correct box, then their work is done. They just want to patch me up and push me on my way so I can stumble through my own sick pantomime of life. 

Life just feels so desolate, so alone. I've tried to help my kids find a place where they can realize their potential. I support all their hobbies, their sports, their creative interests. I'm always doing whatever I can for them. But the school, and the society, and the industrial mill is just going to grind their creativity and passion down just like it does for everyone and there's nothing I can do to stop it. How do you fight the wall of dispassionate faces whose only joy is to say it can't be done? I don't want them to be ground down like I was. I want them to be free to soar like I never was.

It just all feels so useless. The only reason I don't blow myself away is that my kids might still need me for a bit more. But every time I realize that there's an army of dispassionate adults lined up to stand in their way, it just rips my heart out. I feel like Prometheus chained to the rock, doomed to have his heart ripped out everyday and powerless to do anything about it. 

I try to keep a positive face up. I don't want to infect them with my despair. I try to tell them if they work hard they'll be able to pull themselves up and pursue their dreams. But is it true? Is it really just more bullshit? I can't think of saying the alternative to them, because I don't want them to give up. But often I just can't believe it. ",26-08-2025 05:28,17,8

I can’t remember the last time I felt genuine excitement.  Everything that should be exciting is shadowed by the dark reality of life.  Vacation?  That’s my bank account getting emptied or put on a credit card I’ll end up paying 1.5x for.  Holidays?  The same thing or a remorseful “I wasn’t in a great financial place to buy gifts for everybody this year.”  

I’ll admit I don’t follow this sub much, but many of those my age who lurk here probably feel the same way that they may never be able to afford to buy a home or never be able to retire.  I’ll never be able to have a child because I have no idea how we’d afford it.

I just can’t help but feel every dollar made and every dollar spent is stressful both ways.  I pay my rent and taxes to the wealthy.  And here I am, barely scraping by.

I had two near-death experiences as a child but came out mostly unscathed. I became suicidal at the age of 11 and attempted numerous times as a teen but never succeeded. Then I had another near-death experience in my mid-teens. So basically, I feel like God has been telling me I need to die for a very long time, but for some reason I just haven’t yet. So now I’m an adult, and I’m miserable, and the world around me keeps getting worse, and I’m convinced that I’m cursed. I think I’m cursing the world around me by continuing to live.

FOUR of my loved ones have died over the course of 3 years. That’s a really abnormal number. I sometimes wonder if it’s my fault for not dying sooner. Like the balance of the universe is off due to me still being alive, and it’s causing people around me to die. And maybe they’d all still be alive if I had died sooner. Idk.

Maybe on some level I’m causing all of the crazy death and destruction going on in the world right now, too. I know that’s probably a very self-centered way of looking at it, but I’m seriously cursed. I really really am. I was never meant to live this long, and the universe is completely out of balance, and it’s causing all of this chaos. 

So yeah, I’m destined for suicide, I think. If not to spare myself from the pain of living, then to spare everyone else around me from getting hurt by my cursed existence.

Unfortunately, I can’t bring myself to do it, because I have a mom who loves me very much and she would be heartbroken if I killed myself. So I guess I’ll keep on living and cursing everyone around me for as long as she’s around. I hope no one else will die as a result of me being too selfish to kill myself.

I do keep praying for God to kill me, though. If he just killed me already, then it wouldn’t be my fault, and I wouldn’t have the guilt of breaking my mother’s heart. It feels like he’s laughing at me. He’s tried to kill me several times in the past, but once I’m actively begging for it, he refuses. I don’t even know anymore. I want a way out of this. I want to escape my life. I want my life to end so my curse won’t hurt anyone else.",19-08-2025 07:19,17,6

Objectively speaking, my condition is really severe.

Three years ago, I went to a dermatologist and ended up with side effects that worsened my pores and scars. 
After that, I fell into depression. 
Around the same time, I was dumped by my girlfriend and betrayed by my friends. 
All of this completely broke me.
With my face in this condition, I can’t help but feel that they are living happily while I’m stuck like this, and that if they saw me, they would simply look down on me.
That feeling of humiliation has haunted me ever since.
Two years passed, and earlier this year I already lost faith in dermatologists and tried a self TCA peel at home. 
I saw no real improvement, so I went overboard and caused major side effects. 
Even after 7 months, the redness hasn’t gone away, and both cheeks are swollen, making me look even worse.
While there has been some recovery, the condition is still severe. 
I’m not looking for advice on treatments.

What I want to share is that it’s exhausting to keep pushing myself day after day, only to break down again when I look in the mirror. 
Healing will take such a long time, and I’m left with a deep sense of betrayal by the world itself. 
Why should I keep trying in a world that demands so much from me but offers no comfort when I collapse? 
Especially in Korea, life feels harsh and isolating.
I’ve always done my best to meet society’s demands, but when I finally broke down, I was left completely on my own.

Worst time of my life.,"(I’m sorry, this is long, but please someone read this. I need to be seen. I haven’t been able to unpack anything to the people close to me yet)

(16FtM) Five days ago, I attempted to take my life, but my high and drunk self ended up getting too scared so I stopped. I was very hysterical and sad, and really only wanted my mother at that moment. It was late, and she never saw my texts or answered my calls—and while she was downstairs I couldn’t muster the courage to just waltz down there.

I did eventually fall asleep and woke up mostly sober, surprisingly I was not hungover, which was nice. But I made it a point to talk to my mother; and I did.

I told my mother that I tried to attempt and she instantly sprung into action. She went to my father and told him, and they both drove me to the children’s hospital emergency room shortly after. I was skin-checked, and evaluated, and other such procedures were performed. After a few hours waiting in a hospital room I was then escorted to an ambulance and strapped down into a bed and driven to the nearest mental hospital.

I was NOT put on hold, which was good, but I stayed there for the next three days.

Those were the worst three days of my life. I don’t think I’ve ever felt more hopeless and miserable. I was treated so poorly by the other patients, who were mostly aggressive. The only therapy they offered was groups, and I’m such an introverted person that every single one was torture—thankfully they were optional, but the only other thing I could do was sit on the cold hardwood floors and stare at nothing.

I disassociated the whole time I was there, everything felt slow, and odd and I was so confused and scared. I felt like nothing was real and I was wearing some sort of VR headset.

I was called ugly, and other horrible things, and to my unstable mindset anything could be said to me and I’d instantly break down. I started hitting my head, scratching my arms and neck and pulling out my hair out of stress: I hadn’t deliberately hurt myself in YEARS. But that place made me feel so bad that it felt like the only thing I could do. I never spoke to anybody, I never participated, I sat alone, I ate what I could, and I was always crying and trying to keep myself from hurting myself really, really badly. I felt like the moment I would get out I had no other choice but to kill myself—I felt that everything was ruined for me, that there was nothing left.

When my parents visited I was able to have some clarity and I begged them to let me leave, that “this is not the right choice.” I’m so glad they let me leave, I’m so happy to be home. But I feel so broken now, I feel so horrible. I can’t die, but I can’t live. If I ever go back to a mental hospital I’m scared I’m going to kill myself in the most horrific way possible, and pain is the worst thing I can experience right now. That’s how desperate I am.

Has anybody else had an experience like this? I feel like American healthcare is so broken and wrong. I genuinely feel so much worse than I was before, and I tried to KILL MYSELF before. I honestly don’t know how much longer I’m going to be alive for. Jesus Christ dude.

Every morning I contemplate throwing myself down the stairs so I won't have to go. The atmosphere is so unwelcoming and I hate it so much it makes me wanna peel my skin off. The school board does nothing to help and no matter who I explain my trauma to they tell me to suck it up and grow up because I'm not 5 anymore. I used to suffer from severe social anxiety and depression. It's not as bad now but it's something I'm still working on and when I was younger I was a gifted kid who burned out. All the weight and expectations make me wanna puke. I genuinely cannot find myself happy these days. I'm constantly being told to suck it up or give it to God don't worry. I just wanna lay in bed till I disappear and I don't know how to fix it. My parents won't allow me to homeschool unless it's free and they don't have to teach it since they are always busy and not the brightest.

So I'm depressed, largely because the world has been such a cruel and unkind place to me because I do not meet the prerequisites and social expectations of what a black man should be in order to be liked and desired. I'm fat, I'm dark skinned, I don't have a massive dick, I'm LGBTPQIA....... The list goes on and on. Simply put, I'm everything that the world does not want me to be (or need me to be) in order to care about me 

And sometimes that elicits in me a sense of indifference to life on Earth but not just my own life but to humanity as a whole period sometimes I think that I hate humanity. I have no real investments and wanting to make the world and more comfortable place for a shit ton of people, billions I'm sure, who don't want to move in inch to make the world a better place for me. I see how our society has been set up by human beings to leave individuals like me at a disadvantage and, because of this, I often times think that I do not wish to share anything with this world. That giving of myself on any level.....to any degree... it's just too much. 

Over the last 3 years I have had vivid daydreams of setting the entire world on fire and watching it (and all of us) burn in the flames. That speaks to the depth of anger and discuss that I feel towards a world and a species that have left me high and dry intentionally. I become so apathetic that I have no interest in doing anything on any level that will benefit people. I just don't know why the unhappy people, those of us who are the most uncomfortable in this society, sometimes feel the need to show up as martyrs for people who wouldn't even give us a proper burial. 

I don't know, I just hate everyone and I hate everything... And yes, I hate everyone and hate everything because I'm not having the experience I want. But it isn't as if I long to be treated better than or superior to others. The shit I want.....the shit I yearn for..... the shit I pine for which feels so unaccessible to me......is just... a normal life. 

On a daily basis and conversation with humans both on social media and in real life I see how in different people are to being concerned with my feelings and it just conjures up in me a great hatred and disdain towards the human species

Nothing so far has really helped with my depression, and the process to even see if a medication works or not is so insanely long. I have to wait weeks to months to even see if anything changes. The process has been like start med -> nothing changes -> increase dose until almost at max -> still not working -> switch meds repeat and the process takes forever. Each med trial takes months. This might not be so bad and maybe I'd be a little more patient if my depression wasnt so severe that it makes me unable to function. I'm at a point where I'm desperate and I've told my psychiatrist how I'm feeling about it and they insist that if this new med I'm on right now doesn't work, then I should go back to medications I've already tried, but on a higher dose... That means repeating the entire months long process again for something that likely won't even work. For reference I wasn't even on a low dose for those meds either, pretty standard. One of them was 3/4 of the max dose they could even prescribe.

I know thats kinda how it works but i noticed that i lost interest in reading manga and hanging out with friends. I dont brush my teeth cause i cant find the motivation to take care of myself. I sleep with my clothes on constantly which has resulted in me smelling bad and making people disgusted. I cant take showers cause it’s too hard to get myself off the couch or my gaming chair and wash myself. All i do everyday is sleep until 2,3,4 maybe even 5 pm cause so i dont have to be active and when i do wake up i get mad cause im awake. I have lost all motivation to do anything productive. my room is a mess, the house is dirty as shit and i dont eat barely anything anymore. I dont work out so i always feel ashamed of myself when i go out into public because i am ugly, fat , stinky and just over all not a good person to be around. i contemplated suicide but there are too many people who willed be deeply pained by my death so im still here unfortunately. i know i need help or something but i hate social interaction so im not going to go to any therapist or someone like that",22-08-2025 08:05,14,2

I mean my brain feels like it has gone into a coma. It is not reacting. It is not caring. It is just asleep.

A few months ago I cared a lot. About getting into a good college, studying hard, going abroad, chasing that dream version of my life. I actually worked for it. But for the last two or three months it is like someone flipped a switch. Every time I try to study I get anxious, exhausted, miserable, and then the second after it is flat again. My brain just shrugs.

I tell myself You have three months left before entrances. You have not done the course. This is your whole future.  
Brain: **okay.**  
I tell myself Imagine failing, going to some mediocre college, your dream of living in NYC gone.  
Brain: **okay.**  
I try the positive route Imagine your dream school, imagine making it.  
Brain: **okay.**

It is not even sadness. It is not even despair. It is just a dead flatline. It feels like I have lost the ability to care about anything at all no matter how big or small.

And it is utterly terrifying because if this keeps up I am not going to be productive at all. And before someone tells me you just have to be disciplined you just have to do it, I swear I try. I tell myself sit down and study, push through, be disciplined, but it is literally crushing. I cannot even get out of bed. Even when I say to myself you have to study my brain just says **okay** but it does not move. And if it is not that, then every few days I swing into one of these episodes where I completely lash out. I will get so angry over the smallest things like someone leaving my door half open or talking too loudly in class. It consumes me for hours. And then it just collapses back into numbness again.

And it is not just academics. A bunch of my friends cut me off without explanation. One of them literally left me alone in a storm to find my own way. My best friend. At first I was angry. But now If I picture sitting next to them, hearing them laugh without me, I know it would sting a little. But right now It is like I cannot access that feeling anymore. I just think **okay.**

It is the same with joy. I bought a top I really wanted the other day. Usually I would be excited, counting the days until it arrived. Now Nothing. It shows up, it does not, it is all the same. **Okay.**

Even loneliness feels muted. I do not have socials. No one to talk to. My friends are gone. It is just me. That should feel crushing right And I guess a small part of me does feel bad. But most of me Just **okay.**

That is what terrifies me. Not the stress of failing. Not the rejection. Not even being abandoned. What scares me is this indifference. This numbness that swallows up both the good and the bad. Nothing sparks a reaction. Nothing matters.

It does not feel like peace. It feels like my brain has shut off the lights and walked out and I am left here in the dark wondering if it is ever coming back.

Being bombarded with information on referencing, citing, seeing all of the young people running around the halls because it's a college that runs uni courses so everyone is so young. 

I am just so beyond depressed - I've wasted my life. Everyone is so young and driven and they have all this time to do so much.

Fury is a HUGE understatement. Truly there are no words to describe how angry and resentful I am for being alive, and every morning I wake up I feel even worse for being older even though I’m not supposed to be here at all.
My parents are irresponsible my mother should’ve gone to the clinic the same day she found out she was pregnant. Who in their right mind would keep a baby from a random hookup??? And now I pay the full price for their mistakes.. I’m mixed race, have never been accepted by either sides of my family and my father has never really acted like a father figure and I assume it’s because he is white and I look nothing like him, I mean his family used to rant all the time about how I would most likely grow up to be a criminal so I guess it makes sense my own father would see me as lesser than too. 
There is a lot to complain about in my life tbh all I know is that I’m a huge mistake I should seriously not even be in this place at all, I have a deep jealousy of people who are dead if I could switch their places I would in a heartbeat ",06-09-2025 18:45,13,1

 Honestly I have to go throught a lot of pain to unfuck my life but I even if I do it I feel like, I gonna be a half person forever for not having any core memories from my teenage years.The truth is if you don't have any happy memories you can just create some but you live every age once and that fact makes me so miserable I feel like I am gonna live my entire life wishing for a reboot button to appear.

I have noticed that the people who are truly happy are those who are 100% on the present but there is so much guilt,regret,pain and emptiness in my heart and my mind keeps stucking on what ifs about the past( I also have limerence) and daydreaming about the future.

To be honest even if I could rewind time I don't think I would feel better I would still be the same idiot who had to get godly time travelling powers to fix his bs.

I just wish I could be a better person from the start so I could have a more enjoyable life and believe in things like magic,god and fate and that (everythings happen for a reason), that (people meet for a reason) or that (good things naturally come to everyone) and feel that life is truly worth it and not live just cuz my parents will get sad If I  (leave) cuz honestly thats the only thing keeping me and the people out there who wasted even more years and wish they were in my age again.

If you actually read all that do you have anything nice or an opinion to tell me except from your average *you are still so young*.

I’m not sure exactly what I want from this post – maybe advice, empathy, or just to feel less alone. I’m 29, male, gay, and I’ve always struggled with low self-esteem.

Background:

* I grew up in a family with a strange dynamic. My parents had a turbulent relationship, separating and getting back together multiple times. My dad is unemotional and distant – I avoid him because I feel I can’t be myself around him, but then I feel guilty for not spending time with him.
* I knew I was gay from a young age. At 10, I looked at gay porn on the family computer, my family found out, but I denied it. I lived the rest of my childhood with extreme anxiety that I would be found out and would go to jail.
* I was bullied in school, didn’t have many friends, and became a chronic people-pleaser with zero boundaries. I often ended up as the “sidekick” or “annoying little brother” in friendships, never standing up for myself.

Now:

* Friendships & connection: I feel like no one ever truly chooses me. I’m always the one initiating plans, and I dread weekends because they require me to chase others just to have company. Around most friends, I hold back and never feel like my true self. With people who make me feel safe, I overcompensate: texting too much, and being overly energetic. Eventually, they distance themselves. Just this morning, a friend said I’m “exhausting to talk to.” I’ve started distancing myself from friends because their authenticity and carefree attitude make me feel worse about myself.
* Work: I hate my job. I’m unfocused and unfulfilled. It’s a technical, research-based role, but often feels meaningless (tweaking something that already works). I procrastinate constantly in meetings (googling random cities, planning trips, looking up animals). I want a new job, but I struggle to apply unless I’m 100% passionate, and the idea of a rigid 9-5:30 office job terrifies me.
* Hobbies & self-worth: I play rugby and genuinely enjoy it because I’m good at it. It’s one of the few places where I feel respected. But I struggle with the social side (heavy drinking culture, big groups). I’ve let go of other hobbies like piano and gaming because they feel “pointless”, even though I miss them. I’ll try a game for an hour, lose interest, and never go back.
* ADHD & medication: I have ADHD. I’ve tried multiple meds: Concerta, atomoxetine, now lisdexamfetamine – but they either make me depressed or worsen my self-esteem. I tried citalopram for depression in 2022, maybe it helped slightly, but it killed my sex drive and orgasms, which was a side effect I couldn’t tolerate.
* Sex & relationships: I’ve never been in a relationship. I get fleeting validation in the London gay scene for being attractive/in shape, but nothing lasting. Sex itself is anxiety-inducing. I can never get hard, and when I do, I feel disconnected. I had one amazing experience once, but otherwise, it’s been a source of stress and shame.

I feel stuck in this cycle of never feeling good enough – in friendships, in work, in love, in life. I crave connection and purpose but sabotage myself with overthinking, people-pleasing, and avoidance. I am terrified for the future. I don’t feel like I’m ever going to find a stable relationship, have a normal sex life, kick ass at work, buy a house, have children, or grow old.

Has anyone else been through this? How did you start to build genuine self-esteem and break these patterns? Did therapy or certain meds help?",25-08-2025 12:39,13,3

I cut off my entire family. 

I have one close friend. Who lives a state away. 

And dating sucks. Its hard. Im pretty enough to fuck. But not good enough for someone to stick around. Ive isolated myself from dating because I dont want to hookup, and it seems thats all they want these days. 

For the past year Ive struggled with a deep depression that I cant knock… I have daily thoughts of “wanting this to end”, while doing simple tasks. 

Sometimes I question if Im a good person. If I was, wouldnt my family have stayed by my side? Wouldnt I have more friends? Wouldnt I be married? Im probably some type of narcissist and Im totally unaware. 

No sense of purpose. No hope. Everything is numb. I float through the day and dissociate so bad, its hard to keep a conversation. 

I have no community. My coworkers dont notice something is wrong. 

I started baking to cope with how depressed I am. Everyone at work thinks Ive gained a “new hobby” and eat the treats I bring, but I feel as though baking is the only thing holding me here.

When will it end? I cry myself to sleep because Im scared Ill go through with my thoughts. 

Im alone. My body is in pain daily. My career is relentless. And I have no support system or relief. ",20-08-2025 08:22,12,7

I spent all of high school feeling out of place, feeling behind. I was incredibly lonely, and spent most of my night wondering why I couldn’t just be normal, and have friends that actually cared about me. I was beyond excited for college, because I thought things would change. I could meet new people, reinvent myself, find a group where I belonged. All that inspirational bs. I’m 3 weeks in, and everything is exactly the same, if not worse. I’ve been really putting myself out there. I go to all the events, I introduce myself, everything you’re supposed to do. Yet I still haven’t found somewhere I belong. I feel unwanted in every situation. I tried reaching out to people. Tried to arrange a trip to the movies the other day with a group I met. I was basically ghosted by everyone except one girl who answer several hours late. So why even try anymore. I’m just gonna embarrass myself, and get abandoned just like high school.That group is all out tonight, partying, making memories, meeting their lifelong friends. I wasn’t invited. And it’s fine. I know I’m annoying and clingy. So who cares. And I know it takes “time”. But I’ve been hearing that bullshit since freshman year. Everyone said that college would change everything. But it didn’t. How long am I supposed to wait? I’ve been distancing myself from everybody, although that’s not hard. Stop the relationship before they can, and/or will. I’ve spent most days crying and aimlessly wandering. I’m just so tired of waiting. And hoping that things will get better. I’ve been doing that for 12 years, and nothings changed. 

I guess the goal of this post is to hear some inspirational coming of age story from someone to give me home. Or just some reassurance. I don’t really know. ",05-09-2025 07:05,12,3

Normal people always rave about being a ""Jack Of All Trades Master Of None"" is such a good thing to be, but I've come to tell you that, at least in my case, is not.

I used to play sports when I was younger, but phased it out of my life. Football, Soccer, Baseball, etc. Each time, however, I was always the weakest link. You remember being in school, choosing who you want to be on your team for a sport? There was always the kid that nobody picked. I was that, consistently, for every sport. Even if I tried, compared to my peers, I underperformed. I was always weak and slow, never able to run quick enough or tackle anybody. Winning was never fun, because it felt like I accomplished nothing, and losing wasn't fun because they could always point to the weakest link ""doing nothing"" even after trying my all.

So, naturally, since I was a failure at sports, maybe I just wasn't made for sports. Maybe I was made for something less physically involved, like art, or video games, or acting. I tried my hand at regular videogames like platformers, but came across the feeling that it felt like ""nothing being proven."" Even if I ""beat a level"" I'd get the thought of ""Who cares? This isn't something noteworthy. Many people have done this before, it's designed for that, so why bother?""
This just made me get into self imposed challenges, like not dying or not getting hot, but eventually that just took what little fun the game had out by coming down to ""Just delaying the inevitable"". So while I still play videogames, I'm slowly becoming more and more bored with all genres.

So, I tried taking up drawing. It used to be some fun expression of myself, until it wasn't. Art felt like something I could use to express myself, something I could use to show ""me."" But my art, to me, always felt too basic. ""It's just shapes, a child can do this."" To every single piece I make. Hours of hours of work to just simply ""Someone could do this quicker and better, this is nothing."" It expresses me, it's meant to, but it isn't enough. It's just mindless, no matter how much thought is put in, it's mindless.

I feel like everyone who said that being the ""Jack Of All Trades"" is fun didn't specify that they were good at at least one of them. The Jack Of All Trades is fine if you're surrounded by people who can benefit. If you are a ""Master Of None"" you aren't good at anything. You can make a piece of bread, you can use crayons on a piece of paper, you can run a mile a day. If I was built to be able to do everything, but nothing I do is ever good enough for me, then I've been made with no purpose. And if nothing is enjoyable, why would I continue them? Just to fill time until I go back to work? Some life that is.

Honestly, my mind probably has its competitive drive on speed dial, and I tried ""turning it off"" but it really never goes away. And, while I have thought about it, therapy is too much of a risk than a reward anymore due to price and ""getting sent away"".

So, question of the day is: What do you do if you try everything but enjoy nothing?",04-09-2025 21:39,11,2

My mom and my dad are getting divorced. I am stupid, I can barely do anything, and I am still on the level of a 6th grader. My father doesn't want to accept my autism. I will never get a girlfriend, I am gonna be stuck in this fucking class forever. I hate autism so much, I am dumb, and I can't hold a conversation without being awkward. I love my dad, but sometimes it feels like he doesn't love me, I didn't choose to be like this. I think I might be overreacting, but it feels like no one loves me. I want to be like everyone else and talk normally with people and have a bunch of friends, go out together, eat at some restaurant, and go watch movies at the cinema. I want to get a wife and kids and be happy, it feels like I am forced to make choices I don't want to make. These ""Adults"" make me feel like shit. I'll never be good at anything. 

Why does it have to be like this? I love them but they don't love me. I know I am being dramatic, and some people have it 10x worse than me. I just feel so lonely. I am so tired of not being able to control my emotions and feeling like shit every single day.
I wish I didn't have that stupid label on me and could just be treated like every normal person. 
I wish I was neurotypical.

Because it won't. And even it it ""does"" it doesn't actually. It doesn't change what already happened, and I hate when everyone always says you should just get over it and accept it because I can't and won't do that. I don't want to move on because I don't want to accept that I'm weak and helpless and can't do anything about it. I see people who say it always gets better and it seems like they're just coping I hate them so much. The only time I feel any hope is when I have the thought that killing myself will let me start over and do it right this time. I know that won't happen and im scared of the nothingness but I hate everyone and everything and im angry all the time and this feels like the only way to be unless I start lying to myself. Everyone always says the past doesn't define you but imo it 100% does and every day is not a new day it's just a continuation of what came before, and changing your actions doesn't change the past and people who do it just because they fucked up in the past make me want to kill myself. All damage is permanent damage in some way shape or form and your worse off for it and can never really fix it. Even if something does somehow improve it'll just make me miserable thinking it could've been like that the whole time. I wish I was never born because I'll never be who I want to be and it's all my fault. It feels like your only options in life are ""bad"" or ""worse"". I wish I could just say to someone ""I want to kill myself"" but then they'll force me to continue my life and just end up making that life some kind of humiliation ritual anyway. People say suicide is selfish but the thing I think is selfish is making someone who doesn't want to be alive stick around so you don't feel bad. I know I am loved or whatever but it doesn't make me feel any better. I don't want to have to try to be happy and just ignore everything else. Ultimately I think me killing myself is kind of the only option at this point because even though my friends and family will be sad I'm kind of an asshole to my family anyway and I worry sometimes that if I don't kill myself ill kill someone else in the future because I'm so angry all the time. I hate people who say ""life is what you make it"" because its too much pressure life is too much I can't live. I'm only fourteen and I've already messed up so much and it's only gonna get worse and anyone who says otherwise is either really lucky, in denial, or blatantly lying.

Mid 40’s, male, jobless, married and both wife and w/step kid hate me, untreatable medical issues due to loss of insurance/job. No major accomplishments in life other than living this long.

Hell I never deserved any of it. We can all agree that being human trash doesn’t deserve nor warrant having nice things. Every day I’m in pain yet nothing can be done if I don’t have money. Yet human trash doesn’t deserve to profit from selling anything, have nice things or be happy. So I will just have to leave it behind for my wife to sell or throw out, most likely be thrown out.

I grew up in a family who never prepared me for life. Never got me into the habits I needed like hygiene, never taught me how to communicate with people, nothing. Nothing a parent should do for their kid. School teachers and counselors didn't help either, just locked me in mental hospitals instead. Lemme tell ya how little social skills I had. I used to follow kids around saying ""hi"" over and over and over until they'd yell at me, thinking that would make friends. Yeah, I was bad. Now obviously I'm not that bad anymore. But, I still have anxiety when approaching anyone, which usually leads to me not doing it at all. When I do, I get called a creep or flat out ignored. If someone does talk to me, I'm always sweating and shaking and not knowing what to say or how to act, I can't hold eye contact, I say something I shouldn't... I'm bad. What am I supposed to say to a stranger who I try to talk to or who tries to talk to me? All I can say that's anything relevant in my life is ""hey, I finally found the motivation to shower"" or ""I finally forced myself to cook breakfast for the 5th time in my life"". I don't care how you phrase any of that, no one wants to hear about the mundane. That's all I am, is just boring and mundane. Never had friends, as you might've guessed. So, no practice either. Now that I have a job, I've had it for almost 3 years now, that's about the only thing I can hang my hat on. A 3 year job at Walmart. Wah hoo. Before you say it, I've tried meeting people at work, friends and dates. Never worked. In fact, I'm probably the most hated person in that store. I'm seen as this lazy, incapable, asshole. When in reality, my coworkers and managers over the years have made me very stonewalled and cold at work from how I've been treated and taken advantage of. I work, then I come home and sleep. It's that on repeat, and has been for 3 years. Sometimes there's video games thrown in, but as of late, I haven't felt like playing them. I can't drive and haven't had the help to learn. The anxiety of just thinking about being behind a wheel, combined with my severely dangerous thinking sometimes, leads me to the conclusion it's best I don't yet. I still live with family, despite how horribly they treat me, because it's cheaper. I've made such horrible money spending habits that my checks are gone the day I get paid to payment plans and credit. It's a genuine accomplishment when I shower or cook something, when that should just be normal life that never gets brought up. And yet, here I am. You think anyone is gonna look at me and think ""yeah, that's someone I want in my life""? Absolutely not. But what am I meant to do? I'm 25 and yes that's still young. But, everyone I know is some combination of: being able to drive, in a relationship, in or finishing college, or has tons of hobbies and/or friends to keep their life full and busy. What do I have? My goofy gaming laptop that I paid for on payments and my stupid job that I hate but can't leave because of financial struggles. Can people seriously sit here and tell me to look at the bright side when the only bright side is that I showered today or that I got out of bed? Absolutely not, and people shouldn't try to tell me that. Depression combined with anxiety and a complete lack of motivation is the worst combination of things a person can have, and has made me this empty shell of a human with no individuality or personality, no hobbies outside of gaming, no knowledge of anything I should know, and no motivation to change anything, even if I knew what to change and what to do. I didn't even know how to properly shampoo until recently, that's pathetic. I'm a solo artist who's suffering and drowning in his own mistakes and trauma. There's no hope for me, there's nothing I can do. Don't even tell me I've gotta try, get out there and see things, or to try to think more positively. I will not be listening to that.

I have no problems in life. I still live at home, I'm financially well off, I had a perfectly good childhood, I was never bullied or anything. I barely do anything, no job, just a few online college classes. And yet I'm struggling somehow.

I feel nothing or negative most of the time. Sometimes I feel alright, but it doesn't last long. The only time where I feel alive for any longer than a couple minutes is when I'm talking with my online friends. Then I feel okay. It's gone quickly after I leave them. I'm tired every day. I shower once a week, I can't find the energy or willpower to do anything more. My teeth are in shambles, I've had so many cavities. I hardly ever brush, maybe a couple times a week. I know that it's disgusting. I can barely get through my classes. I do the absolute bare minimum, just enough to pass. I don't do my homework until the weekend (a couple days before the deadline) 90% of the time.

Am I just that lazy? What is wrong with me? Could I be depressed when I have such an easy and simple life? It doesn't seem possible.

i think that i might be insane. for some reason i can recognize that what im doing is wrong. but i cant seem to stop. 

4 years ago me and my ex broke up, and i ended up creating a fake account to stay in contact with my ex. i don’t remember all of the details probably bc i pushed it down. but ultimately as the alter ego i convinced my ex to get back together with me. but of course things didn’t work for a while and eventually while i was still talking to my ex, i killed off the fake account. 

i know that’s awful, but i can’t seem to stop. the last guy i went on dates with was ghosting me so i downloaded a fake number and called him to see if smth was wrong. and i honestly justified it in my head by saying that i just wanted to check that he was alive. but it was so clearly not that. and even now ive been talking to another guy for a couple of days. he may have been ghosting me and i downloaded a fake number to text him and call him. he thinks im some other girl he gave his number to. and i’m still thinking about how i can make things right with him. like i want to go on a date with him. i still like him yet im doing all of this sneaky underhanded stuff. 

i can never talk to my friends about this because i honestly think this stuff is insane, and borderline abusive. i know i shouldn’t be doing this but i cant seem to kick this compulsive energy inside to still do these things. 

i try telling my therapists about this, but they always seem to skirt around the fact im saying i have such a great conflict within myself. i feel like i am always fighting this evil person inside of me and i cant help but think im such a bad person for these things that maybe i dont deserve help. 

it gets to a point where i am obsessively doing tiktok sounds for manifestation. praying compulsively and trying to convince god to do these good things for me for once. i always seem to struggle with this idea that god might be punishing me. so either i have to take it all into my own hands or beg god to finally do something for me. 

i dont know if this is similar to anything someone here has experienced but i really do need help. i just dont know what to do because all my therapists cant break it down what im supposed to do to get better. ",04-09-2025 18:52,11,5

I've had gad and intermittent panic disorder since I was a kid. I'm in my thirties now and I'm just stumbling onto these tricks. I'm underplaying it when I say these would've changed the course of my life. 

You’ve probably heard of splashing cold water on your face during a panic attack. What I didn’t realize until recently is that this isn’t just a distraction — it’s actually triggering something called the mammalian dive reflex. It’s a built-in reflex all mammals have that slows your heart rate, calms your system, and basically flips your body out of “panic mode.” ER doctors literally use it on patients with racing hearts (SVT) by dunking their face in ice water.

So here’s what I’ve been doing:

I keep ice water nearby.

When I feel a surge coming on, I take a breath and do a gentle Valsalva (basically blow lightly against closed lips, like 3 out of 5 effort).

While holding that, I splash my face with the ice water.

*EDIT: The effects of magnified significantly if you get your head below your heart. Hold breath, begin pouring water, bend over, keep trying to lightly exhale into tightly closed lips, wait about twenty seconds. You can keep a steady stream of water going this whole time.*

Between the cold trigger and the light breath hold, my panic spikes are over in like 15–20 seconds.


I know everyone’s different, but for me, this has been the closest thing to an “off switch” I’ve ever found. Even just knowing I have it takes away a lot of the fear.

If you’ve tried cold water before, this is basically the same thing, just stacked with a light breath hold for an extra kick. Figured I’d put it out there in case it helps somebody else like it’s helped me.

Stay safe, everyone. You’re not broken — your body just needs the right signals to calm down.",30-08-2025 17:47,1024,110

Went to an event and networked with everyone, that's how I got my tech internship, everything was smooth and feeling like I HAVE FOUND A CURE for my anxiety bro like where were you all this time when I suffered.

Now the biggest challenge was that I created a personality that can only be maintained by xanax, I was in charge of daily stand-ups and had more responsibilities. Felt like work was easier, started attending Hackathons and tech summits, and a linkedin influencer. I was in control.

On the 4th month, I started to hit tolerance and panicked adding alcohol, cigarettes, codeine and weed to the mix. I would take 20 pills (1mg) just for stand-up and say 

""im still testing the endpoints of that CRUD api""

""Which one?""

""The one from yesterday"".

Then I would black out for the rest of the day then repeat tomorrow, I was averaging 2 tickets per week while others do 30. I thought I was in control.

NOOO!

People also don't understand how horrendous the anxiety medications are. A good 90-95% of the medications offered to you will suck; They'll hurt your stomach, give you headaches, give you muscle spasms, and my favorite.... destroy your love life. About 90% of meds will render you useless in the bedroom. You can't even make love to your woman, and she'll get pissed off and leave you because you can't even keep an erection for her. 

But you can always get therapy? Well sure that could work but it can take many months to years! What the hell are you supposed to do in the meantime while waiting for the therapy to work? You can't put your job on hold while waiting for therapy to work. No, they'll just fire your ass, and then you won't be able to afford therapy.

10: A heart attack is a physical event. Most commonly it's caused by a block in one of the coronary arteries and your heart isn't getting enough blood. Usually it's caused by a buildup of cholesterol. This is not what's happening to you. A heart attack isn't caused by stress, anxiety, panic, or exercise. It's caused by a physically clogged coronary artery.

9: Because you've been dying from this same ""heart attack"" since you started having Panic Attacks. Listen, Red Foxx: How many times have you thought you were (literally) dying and discovered you were wrong? Nothing's different. You're wrong this time too.

8: How do you know this? Because a Doctor's examined your EKG, Photos of your heart and coronary arteries, and knows the difference between the physical event of a heart without enough blood and a perfectly healthy one. They didn't miss anything. Nothing! This isn't the 1950's. They have the most cutting edge medical technology in the history of Medicine. They didn't miss a thing.

7: Because Heart Attacks don't get better, they get worse. If it's still happening at this intensity in 20 minutes then maybe you got a problem. But, it won't be. It's going to fade the way it always does. Besides: you have plenty of time to get to the Hospital. This isn't a TV Heart Attack where people just keel over. REAL heart attacks are clogged coronary arteries slowing the blood rate to your heart. It takes a while to kill you. Like HOURS.

6: Because people who have had both Heart Attacks and Panic Attacks say they are not the same at all. The symptoms look similar on paper, but, real (for real) heart attacks are physical events with a clear distinction between the two.

5: Because if you're under 45 and in reasonable shape your chances of having a heart attack are VERY low. They drop dramatically if you've had the standard Heart-related Emergency Room work-up within the last couple of years.

4: Because if it was a heart attack you wouldn't be on Reddit right now.

3: Because an actual heart attack is probably WAY less horrifying than how you feel right now.

2: Because you're not the special 1-in-a-Million case that is having that rare, under 40, undiagnosed heart attack in spite of all statistical probability, and in defiance of all that Doctor's everywhere know to be true. And, you know this!

1: Because in 15 minutes it's going to slowly fade and you'll be alright. This is not the end. You will still be here tomorrow, and the next day, and the one after that. Somewhere, deep down, you know that you're not actually dying. It just really, really, really feels like it.

Heart Attacks are physical events that we have a great deal of control over. Want to stop worrying?

·Quit smoking ·Lose those extra pounds ·Start eating better NOW. Not in your 40's or 50's. ·Have a Doctor look over your heart, bloodwork, and overall physical health. If for nothing else than peace of mind. · Start exercising ·Watch your cholesterol intake.

That way you can enjoy your Panic Attack for what it really is: The unbearable roller-coaster of sheer horror and terrifying physical symptoms that won't actually kill you despite their repeated threats.

Is there a name for this? Does this happen to others with anxiety?

I'm realizing I'm nothing but an NPC or side-character in everyone's life and my loyalty has meant nothing. I'm not sure what the point is.,"I honestly don't feel 40.  In my head, I still feel like I'm in my mid-twenties.  I've got expectations on me now at this age that I really don't want to have, and I really only subscribe to the stereotypes others want me to fill when I absolutely have no choice.

What does bother me though is that I'm realizing now at this age that I am completely unimportant and disposable to everyone.

I've never really been that important of a person to anyone.  I can be easily replaced at work.  I'm seemingly never anyone's first choice to hang out with.  People always choose boyfriends, girlfriends or spouses over me.  No one ever messages or calls me just to check in on me, only if they need something.  When I am in a public place, it seems like I'm invisible to everyone.  Whenever I try to show someone kindness or loyalty, it's never really returned.

Really a lot of the times it feels like I'm taken advantage of  Like I'm trying to bring positivity or meaning to others, but nothing is ever returned.  I'm truly not that important to anyone really.

For once in my life, I'd like to know what it's like for people to smile when I walk into a room.  To be on someone's mind to just invite out after work.  To just get a message asking me how I'm doing.  It seems like everyone relies on me to be the person who can do something for them but when I need anything at all, everyone's suddenly busy or is doing something with someone else.

Now that I'm aging into irrelevance and even less importance, the milestone of turning 40 is a reminder that it isn't going to get any better.

I do the usual grounding stuff, breathing exercises, journaling, trying to be rational but sometimes it feels like my brain is just determined to panic. I just everything down to Eureka Health whenever the anxiety is tied to health worries. It helps me slow down and gives me a more level headed breakdown instead of letting my imagination run wild.

I’m not really scared of dying. It’s not something I think about often and when I do it doesn’t fill me with fear. What does terrify me is failing like failing at my career failing the people who believe in me or failing to live up to the expectations I’ve set for myself. That fear is constantly there shaping the decisions I make and sometimes holding me back entirely. The weird thing is that the only time I get a break from that pressure is when I’m completely focused on something else that makes me hyper focused like playing grizzly’s quest for example or just going through some crazy reddit posts. It’s exhausting because on the outside I act like I have it together like I’m confident and ambitious. Inside I’m driven by this constant worry that I’m not good enough and that if I mess up I’ll be exposed as a fraud. I know logically that failure is part of life and part of growth but emotionally I can’t shake the idea that it would mean I’m worthless.

I don’t talk about this with anyone because I feel like it makes me sound weak like I’m supposed to just “man up” and push through it. But hiding it doesn’t make it go away it just festers quietly. Writing this here feels like the first honest thing I’ve said about it in a long time.

I have been in a constant state of stress and anxiety for years. Panic attacks, overthinking, with severe anxiety anytime I had to leave the house. 

I was just diagnosed in my 20s with adhd. And I have to say that adhd meds have changed my life. For the first time in years I actually feel calm, like my nervous system is finally no longer in fight or flight. My brain is quiet, I no longer want to bang my head against the wall. The anxious thoughts still appear, but they are so quiet I barely hear them. 

Turns out, untreated adhd has been the root of my anxiety and depressive symptoms. Taking adhd meds has changed my life. I truly thought that I was doomed forever and that I was always going to live suffering, being eaten alive constantly by anxiety. But I’ve found relief, so I just had to share that there is hope <3

My anxiety consists of a lot of negative, anxious thoughts with a fast and palpitating heart beat. If the anxiety gets bad enough, it causes me to spiral and eventually emotionally breakdown. I also have social anxiety and performance anxiety which the Propranolol helps as well. I don't get anxiety attacks, nor do I get panic attacks. Just a mental dread and anguish that doesn't seem to end at times.

In my experience, my anxiety is like a feedback loop. Something triggers me and then I spiral with negative thoughts, and then I have a fast heartbeat. Rinse and repeat. But when I take Propranolol it helps my racing heartbeat and adrenaline which in turn helps my mental thoughts and stops the feedback loop in its tracks. I believe the physical and mental are connected so if you stop physical anxiety, you may decrease or stop the mental anxiety. And vice versa.

I've been taking Propranolol 6 months. I just took it now after have a mental breakdown from anxiety. I felt dread, my mind was racing, my heart was beating fast. 10-30 minutes later I feel very relaxed and I can think clearly. I feel okay now. I don't have any side effects either. It seems to be a very ""light"" medication for anxiety in terms of side effects. 

A downside could be that it usually only lasts around 3-5 hours. Some people take it 2-3 times a day for that reason. For me, I just take it as needed when I have those mental breakdowns and that's usually anywhere from 0-3 times a week.

Okay that's all. I just wanted to share how Propranolol helped my anxiety. I know all medications affect people differently so Propranolol might not work for you. Thanks for reading!",20-08-2025 17:53,172,91

Her mom and sister were both diagnosed with breast cancer almost at the same time and ever since then she’s been convinced she’s next.

She’s been to doctor after doctor, test after test, and every result has come back fine but the relief never lasts within days, sometimes hours, she’s back in panic mode, checking her body for signs that something’s wrong. She even started using Eureka Health as kind of an AI second opinion between appointments, just to keep her from spiraling. She told me it actually helps her pause before going down the what if rabbit hole which I think has made things a little easier, but the fear is still there always humming in the background.

It made me realize how powerful health anxiety can be, even when the evidence says you’re okay. As if our brain just refuses to believe it no matter how many clean results you get or how many doctors reassure you. With her the fear has a life of its own, logic and proof don’t touch it. One day she’s relieved after an appointment and the next she’s back to checking herself in the mirror, convinced something slipped through the cracks.

I feel like I have no control over my own brain anymore because I’m stuck in a constant state of anxiety. It’s gotten so bad that I’ve also been struggling with depersonalization and I unfortunately have constant anxious thoughts about my health even though (according to my PCP) I’m healthy. I think the worst part about this experience is the highs and lows. It’s genuinely exhausting, feeling like one day I’m okay/normal again just for the next day to be the start of weeks of panic attacks and overthinking. I will say that having community has definitely helped during my darkest moments and if I didn’t have support from family and friends I don’t know how I would’ve gotten through those times, but I feel like I’m trapped in my own body. Every day, I think about death and dying, and I wish it would just stop.  I was prescribed 10mg of Fluoxetine, but I'm anxious about taking medication that might make me worse until I'm used to it. To be honest, I don’t think I’m strong enough and, because I’m working, I don’t really have the time to deal with any more obstacles in my life, but talking about it helps and kind of distracts me from spiraling into a panic attack.

It started with plain old anxiety, then I started getting hot and cold flashes. I have a history of panic attacks but had never experienced them before. I have barely eaten in the last 3 days (2 slices of bread was the most I could manage today) and didn't eat at all for the first 2 days because all food made me gag. My chest and head felt like they were being squeezed to DEATH. My arms and legs felt numb. I was shakey. The physical sensations are honestly worse than the sense of dread itself. The only way I couls get them to go away was by crying, but once I stopped they all came back. 
 
I had no idea panic attacks could get this bad. At most my panic attacks used to last like 45 minutes and I'd just kinda feel like crap the rest of the day. At the 24-hour mark, I Googled when to go to the ER for panic attacks and decided to go. I thought it was a stupid reason to go and was embarrassed at first.

Holy crap, I'm glad I went. They got me into a bed, taught me breathing techniques, one of the nurses held my hand and hugged me. The lady who does insurance came in and told me I reminded her of her granddaughter and gave me encouraging words. The panic attack didn't totally go away, but a lot of the physical sensations calmed down. They got me to see a psychiatrist who perscribed temporary medication until I can get an appointment with a regular one. 

I've been percribed Lexapro for daily use and Xanax as needed. But the Xanax is short-lasting, up to 3 times a day, and it only helps an hour at a time. The meds lowkey aren't enough and my panic attack is ongoing with short breaks when I take the Xanax. So I'm definitely far from fine yet. But I wouldn't have had even a moment of calm without the help of the ER staff. 

If your local hospital is a decent one, don't feel afraid to go if your anxiety won't go away. Heck, mine has low ratings but they're great whenever we come in. A lot of hospitals offer income-based financial assistance and can help even if you don't have insurance. And remember they're busy in the ER - I had a long wait before getting in an actual bed but they at least gave me privacy in their consultation room instead of making me cry in the busy waiting room. Mental health is usually high-priority. 

Lowkey the only reason I was able to calmly type this is because my meds just kicked in so apologies if I can't reply to any responses later 😅 It usually only lasts an hour and this was the last one I can take today. 

But I hope everyone on this sub is doing okay. And don't forget to call a hotline if you really need to talk to someone. I did it for the first time recently and it was awkward but helped a ton. Consensual hugs to everyone 💜",06-09-2025 00:25,136,43

When I say do less I mean stop feeding the cycle. When you get those physical sensations just let them happen, imagine yourself calmy walking through the internal storm, it is only adrenaline. Nobody ever died from anxiety.

When those horrible dark intrusive thoughts show up, LET THEM. Don't google, don't start thinking about them just point out they are just thoughts and have no true depiction of reality. Learn to be the observer of your mind.

It is hard to implement at first, but if you can do it for like 5 minutes before caving in, that is a HUGE WIN. Practice and consistency is huge here, if you can do this then over time the anxiety monster will get smaller and smaller until it only shows up when you actually need it.

They reached out to me on LinkedIn and said my experience seems to align really well with what they are looking for, and can I come for an interview.

This was already amazing as I didn’t even apply, they chose me from the beginning. I don’t know why this didn’t calm me down or reassure me in anyway. But yeah as soon as it was arranged I got really anxious. The interview arranged on the Monday for the Thursday, so I had a couple of days to prepare. I did lots of research into the company and the role itself, as well as working on an elevator pitch. I was rehearing so much but I feel like this only make me more anxious and felt more pressured. 

When the day rolled around, I almost didn’t go, I was walking up to the doors and thought about turning back, my heart was racing. Even when I was in the lift I thought about backing out. 

I got into the room and made sure to introduce myself well, I stood up to greet them and introduced myself despite them already knowing my name, but I just thought that would be good manners. I made small talk while they set up. But inside my heart was pounding. 

I had planned for them to begin with a “tell us about yourself” type question, but she asked me “talk us through your experience” which is arguably similar. However this is an entry level job and even tho I do have previous experience, I felt as though I was limited in this question, I had planned to talk about my degree and volunteering, which I guess could tie in to experience, but this just through me all off. I got two sentences in and started choking up, I asked to go to the toilet but as I got up the tears just came out. They was so nice about it, and said take your time, I said that I had ruined it already, and they said not at all and to just come back and we can start fresh. 

To be fair at that point I just wanted to leave I was about to walk away but then decided to preserver and continue. Once I got it out my system I did calm down and was able to answer all their questions, and I feel like I answered them well but obviously not as well as I had planned. 

I also had to do an assessment and I have no idea how that went, I feel kinda confident but I feel like I couldn’t fully think straight so who knows.

Have I completely blown my chances? I feel so defeated. I keep replaying it in my head and it’s just awful, why do I always panic? It’s not a true reflection of how I am, if I got the job, I know I could do it so well and I do work well under pressure, I just don’t know what happened. ",12-09-2025 08:53,129,14

- Numbness and tingling in hands and feet 
- Stomach pains and nausea 
- Elevated heart rate 
- High blood pressure (some as high as 160/109)

Like, when someone asks ""How's it going?"" we automatically say ""Good, busy!"" and move on. We share our wins but hide our struggles. We optimize productivity but ignore our mental health.

I had a friend who got his dream promotion - six-figure salary, team of 15, LinkedIn flooded with congratulations. But he called me that night sobbing because his marriage was falling apart and he hadn't seen his kids awake in days. The next morning? Posted a celebration photo. 1000+ likes. Not one person asking if he was okay.

**Does this resonate with anyone else? How do you deal with the gap between how your life looks and how it actually feels?**

Although we frequently mistake it for ""anxiety out of nowhere,"" it's a genuine bodily reaction. What can exacerbate anxiety in the morning? Insufficient or interrupted sleep Too much caffeine on an empty stomach too soon Low blood sugar (eating too late or skipping breakfast) Spending time on screens just before bed Hormonal changes, irregular shifts, and chronic stress Simple methods that are frequently beneficial to people (not medical advice):After waking up, open the curtains or spend two to five minutes in the sun. Putting off coffee for sixty to ninety minutes and starting with a protein and fiber meal exhaling more slowly than inhaling (for example, a 4/6 count or two ""physiological sighs"") Light exercise: take a quick stroll or stretch for three to ten minutes.

From the outside, you might look totally fine. Inside, it feels like your whole system is on high alert. And the hardest part is you can’t just “turn it off.” It takes patience, coping tools, and sometimes support to quiet the alarm.

In other words, the word is actually you and your physical body is just armour and tools. 

Notice: How nothing that happens to you seems to affect this aspect, it remains intact on the wall regardless of everything.

I've f(22) dealt with a pretty serious anxiety and panic disorder for about two years now. 

I was on Lexapro for about 6 months (forget the dosage) and my psychiatrist ended up switching me to 100mg sertraline which worked much better for my anxiety. It killed my libido and made me sweat so badly I decided I wanted to try getting off of my meds. 

Over the last four months I've been slowly lowering my dosage per my psychiatrist and about two weeks ago, we got it down to where I've completely stopped. 

The withdrawal is rough and I come home after my 9-5 and feel this overwhelming dread if I don't have immediate plans with people. 

Legit, im just wondering what people do when they don't have anything to do. I'd love some advice on things that help you but I also am just curious what people legitimately do, because I feel so disconnected to what y'all do post 9-5. 

TLDR; What do y'all do when you're alone and not with friends/family to keep yourself from having anxiety attacks? I don't care how silly or stupid it is, anything helps <3",01-09-2025 19:29,58,50

I really liked her personality and she understood the feelings I was expressing, but towards the end of the session while there was some silent space while she was looking up something, I said I liked her decorations (very bohemian/eclectic). One piece I comment on led her to saying she was very into astrology, even pointing at a book on her desk and saying she uses it to explain to a lot of her clients about themselves, and that we’re all connected to the cosmos.

This immediately raised up red flags for me. Sure, I’ve found it fun to read weekly horoscopes and did my birth chart, but I would never take real meaning from it. “A broken clock is still right two times a day” type of thing. 

She also said she was a huge follower of Freud; I don’t know if this is antiquated at all.

I don’t know what to do. I thought I really liked her based on her personality, but I don’t know how I view going back to her. Is this worth proceeding forward with?

if your body needed to throw up, it would. there would be no prolonged nausea for hours on end, it would just happen. for me, the best bet is 30-40 minutes. if you’re STILL nauseous after that then chances say you’re not ill, it’s anxiety. 

anxiety can manifest in so many different ways with nausea being one of them. the brain and gut have some kind of relationship meaning when you’re getting stressed, your stomach is also which results in GI issues, including nausea!

Hi guys

Hope all is well for you. Im wondering if anyone else has gone through this phenomenon? 

Today I woke up much earlier than I usually do with this super bad feeling. I usually wake up at like 9 am. but when I have these weird moments, I wake up a lot earlier. Sometimes I wake up at 4 am but today it was 6 which is still a few hours before I normally wake up. Idk how to describe the feeling I woke up to but it just feels awful and super uncomfortable and I also feel this cooling sensation for some reason. Maybe that was adrenaline but idk. It causes me to have an anxiety attack and then It calms down for a minute and then it comes back. it usually goes away after a few minutes but in those few minutes it genuinely feels like the end of the world it’s pretty scary. Please tell me I’m not the only one. I experience this once in a while and it’s scary.

Recently this past year, around the beginning of the year m, I decided after doing a lot of research to finally see a doctor and I ended up getting prescribed an SSRI called Mirtazapine.

This is for anxiety and insomnia, and I have to admit that my life has gotten way better since doing to In literally every single aspect of my life.

My sleep has become normal for the first time ever, my mood is stable, my focus at work is better and I’ve been making the most money I’ve ever made, my fitness is at its best, I have an amazing relationship with my gf and my friends and I have way more motivation and desire to do fun things in life.

I’ve had some childhood traumas and adhd growing up and due to pressures of masculinity I’ve learned through my culture and upbringing, the idea of getting professional help was something I’ve resisted forever but I ended up saying screw it and took control of my own life.

A friend of my who’s a psychologist is really who taught me to unlearn all the BS I believed about seeking professional help. 

This is not a post made to pressure anyone to get help aswell or to try and get meds, I just wanna say I wish I got help sooner.

I genuinely believe if I got help maybe in like highschool, right now I would be wayy further in life and more successful.

Because I was that guy who was always sabotaging jobs and relationships because of crippling anxiety and severe insomnia and paranoia and my family made me believe that I was just being dramatic.

I literally had childhood trauma, traumatic injuries as a child, even cancer, being bullied, etc.

My jaw and teeth began trembling from the fear of waking up with a tooth cracked in two. You need to trust your doctor and body to get better with time and treatment. My condition has improved drastically as my mental health has improved, and I’m starting to cope with the discomfort or pains I get rather than withdrawing from the outside. 

It is a vicious cycle, but googling symptoms and reading anecdotes does nothing to aid your recovery in things like muscle tension, headaches and other symptoms caused by anxiety and especially OCD. 

See your doctor, get checked out, take care of yourself and take the time to learn how to trust your body again. It can be so frustrating to be told “it’s probably stress/anxiety” but in many cases, it can cause or exacerbate illnesses or conditions. Mental wellbeing is such a HUGE factor in keeping your heart, muscles, skin, kidneys, liver… any body part healthy and functioning!

Please, consider deleting TikTok or Reddit, or even physically tucking away your phone to avoid the urge to google symptoms and read stories. This has been the biggest help for me and I see more and more people on the TMJ subreddit note how important getting off Reddit was in aiding their recovery, I think this applies to many conditions related to anxiety.",09-09-2025 03:29,41,16

It’s been maybe 5 months since and it’s very clear than I fucked up my nervous system and that it just wasn’t strong enough to handle the shit I was throwing at it- poor sleep, shit tons of caffeine, new nicotine routine. I was also very negative and didnt have any grounding activity.

I’m honestly really stressed out and could use some reassurance or to hear from people who’ve been through something similar.
I’ve been dealing with health anxiety for the past two years, and it’s exhausting. Even when my medical reports come back normal, I can’t shake the fear that something serious is hiding underneath. I even avoid going to the doctor sometimes because I’m terrified of what they might find, even though logically I know that makes things worse.
Here are some of the things I experience:

Numbness and tingling in my hands and feet.

A weird heavy feeling in the temporal/occipital parts of my head, almost like pressure or buzzing.

Pain under my ears. i feel like my neck shakes and cant support my head.

Internal “tremors” , like my body feels shaky inside even though it isn’t.

The constant fear that I might suddenly go into a seizure (even though I never actually have).


I’ve noticed these feelings get worse when I’m on my laptop or doing long screen time, so I’ve cut back a lot.

It honestly feels terrifying, like my body is on edge 24/7. But at the same time, I keep wondering… are these just anxiety symptoms? Does anyone else get stuff like this?

I feel trapped in this cycle of worry → symptom → more worry. Any stories, reassurance, or advice would mean a lot right now.

Thanks for reading 🙏

I have lived in a 24/7 (literally...) state of fight or flight, impending doom and worst of all, hypervigilance.  I feel stuck in this state of mind, unable to relax even when I know it's safe to.  It's horrible and exhausting.  I have tried many medications over the years including countless antidepressants, antipsychotics and anti anxiety ones.  I am currently on clonazepam (but tapering off...even THIS doesn't take it away) and propranolol 40mg 2x per day.  I will say, propranolol has kind of helped some but still feel very anxious and unable to feel safe enough to just let go.

The only medication I have ever taken that actually snapped me out of it was Ativan of all things.  I know it's a benzo but I have tried xanax too and that didn't do much for me.  Ativan was only prescribed for 1 week for alcohol withdrawals a few years ago so would not be able to take this again.

Since then I learned so much about anxiety and tried so many things. I lost my job along the way and now I feel 99% normal again. That one percent is the realization of me being anxious and having the courage to manage it.

I know too well during those days, the never ending thoughts, sleepless nights, heart sinking, palpitating, sweating. The despair.

I am here to share my journey and give you hope: no matter how hopeless, there is a way to recover.

Let me cut the long story short. Here are what worked for me: 

1. Listen to lots of meditation and anxiety guides. Voice is such a good interruptor for racing thoughts. I had hard time concentrating through reading. Listening to meditation even when I am not anxious. 

2. Talk to someone. I am fortunate to have a sister who experienced and understood anxiety disorder, she gave me so much strength when I was in such a mess. I talked to her everyday in those difficult days.

3. Eat healthy. My appetite didn't get depressed during anxiety disorder. I ate healthy food, lots of green and protein. Absolutely no caffeine and alcohol.

4. Mild Exercise. I ran a few 15-20 miles a week. Cut down from before. I did resistance training to build some muscle. I want to be tired before bed

5. Take supplements, melatonin for sleep. Vitamin B for nerve health.

6. Truly ""give up"". Take one day at a time. Don't plan for tomorrow or next week, or the future. Just experience life as it comes. Experience pain. Let it hurt, don't avoid.

Losing my high paying job turned out to be a good thing. I worked a totally new job. Things are messy, difficult, but I had different approaches. No longer need perfection, and I only care about today. Not to think tomorrow at all.

I am not on any medication. I had hydroxyzine and benzos but didn't work for me.

Ask me anything. I know this is hard to come by. I was on this forum looking for help before. I am willing to share as much as I can if that can help your anxiety.

Anyways, I woke up from a very good sleep with terrible CRUSHING pain on my upper back. Lord it scared me SO bad. It was radiating to my jaw and arms. I woke up I felt it I’m like WTH I sat up I couldn’t breathe, my HR got up to 125. BP was 144/75. And someone with severe cardiophobia, naturally I freaked out. I called 911. 

Thankfully by the time I was finished getting dressed I realized that I was probably okay.. this isn’t my first rodeo. But let them come anyways. My blood pressure has lowered and my HR also. Still on the higher end but lowered fairly quickly. They did the work up. And asked me if I wanted to go. I said no, not at the moment. 

I am now sitting up in my bed and watching my favorite tv show. 

I am trying to find some kind of relief in what I just experienced by posting this and to see who’s awake really.

A couple days ago I had a smoke and then proceeded to choke the chicken (as you do) but not too far in a numbness/pins and needles sensation took over my body, making it so that despite being able to move my fingers and extremities, if I looked away I couldn’t feel I was moving them (proprioception). This was quickly followed by a sudden increase in my heart rate, and an overall sense of impending doom. I realised I was panicking and tried to calm down with breathing, laying down, and taking a shower. The numbness however would return in waves, my rapid heart rate persisted, which I could hear and feel through my chest, and my body would randomly shiver intensely. Multiple negative thoughts crossed my mind such as my history of high blood pressure, which led to more panic and essentially catapulted me into a negative feedback loop of anxiety and dread, to the point where I Ubered to the hospital, in fear I was having a heart attack. My heart would’ve been working overtime for about 1-2 hours until the hospital setting put me at ease. That numbness however would return every now and then until the next day, and now I still feel anxious about the situation and will probably take a big break from buds.

He then proceeded to be like one of those crazy vegans or Christians that rant and push their beliefs on to you. He said he was ‘concerned’ about all the processed food I’m eating. That I’m killing myself by *eating. Even though it’s processed, ready made meals. 

But not everyone can make homemade meals all the time. He thinks he so perfect. Eats healthy, exercises, has his fireman job, kids and ‘fiancée’ whose he’s had for 7 years now.. hasn’t married her officially yet and probably never will. 

He then proceeded to say to my face, ‘I’ll see you at your funeral in a few years. Cause that’s where you’re headed’…

I was speechless. How do you say that to someone? Especially your younger family member? I’m 27F, but I haven’t always eaten processed foods.

So they took my blood, put me on a IV, were asking me things but again I was like... barely replying.  
They tried to make me do things like lift legs and cough? etc, after.... awhile, idk. Took the IV out and and eventually gave me ativan and let me spend the night - it didn't take me long to fall asleep after the ativan, then sent me home in the morning.

Usually, meditating would fix it, but l was using it to run away instead of facing it, and meditation has this nasty habit of trial by fire, forcing you to face the parts of yourself hidden deep down. For the first month l was laying in bed trying to run away from it by meditating and watching youtube (didn't work), dissociated for the first few months as well, being scared of essentially everything.

Here is what l did to overcome it.

1. Exposure therapy. No more suppressing the fear or distracting myself, l went head on and faced my phobias. Black holes, tank from l4d2, hanus the big spider from spaceman, and that weird creepypasta smiling dog were the main ones. Everytime l felt anxiety, l would retraumatize myself by looking the triggers up on google images or learning more about them, this lead to a few panic attacks at the beginning, but l would reward myself with compliments and a nice treat each time. I would do exposure therapy especially when super anxious, it made me realize the triggers had nothing to do with anxiety, but doing exposure therapy calmed me down. This was the key to it.

2. Separate the trigger from your anxiety. Fear of death and loss of loved ones got to me hard, but l knew deep down that once separated from the emotion of anxiety, they were just regular thoughts that hold no power over me. So l tried my best to do that.

3. Positive affirmations. Seriously, they hold immense power. My favorites are is ""zen masters would fart and laugh at the idea of fearing anything in this world"" (they actually would, too) and ""do l give a damn tho"" followed by a laugh.

4. Working out and daily walks. Cardio will help immensely, daily walks will refresh you. Short moments of peace are beautiful tools to overcome stress, the less stress you have the less potent the anxiety.

5. Meditation. It can be scary at first, your mind fresh with scary thoughts and images, but guess what ? Sitting through your fears is THE MOST powerful way of getting your body to realize fears, thoughts and images can't do anything. You are the infinite sky afraid that some clouds may hurt you. Be warned though, meditation will put you out of dissociation, which your brain put you in bc it was scared of being hurt, so you will experience fear much harder. Good news is, this will make you able to face the fear head on without the need to dissociate.

Lastly, the most important step is facing the anxiety itself. The best way is to imagine it as a waterfall. If you sit under a waterfall and get wet, you can either get angry and pissed, or you can say ""oh well, it's just some water.""

It's just some water. Change your mindset from running away from anxiety to running towards anxiety, hug it, make it your partner, and one day you'll wake up and enjoy tackling it :)

A word about panic attacks, l can feel them coming sometimes, my go to method when l'm shaking trembling in fear is ""more, give me more, let's do this, l love panic attacks.""

A 5 minute meditation trick, sit down and focus on the feeling, don't run from it, just look at it as if it were a silly kitty playing in the dirt. It'll go away VERY fast, and you can repeat this meditation forever, the better you get at this, the shorter time it takes you to overcome the emotion, nowadays, if l get random anxiety, l just look into a random object and meditate on the feeling, after 30-60 seconds it's gone. Usually happens 2-3 times a day, but it's very mild.

""Of course it's difficult, good things take time and perseverance my friend.""

May you find the same peace l have",26-08-2025 07:22,28,1

I've been exploring new ways to deal with anxiety, and I came across a method that really helps me out!! Meditation or stuff like that hasn’t really helped me it just stops my thoughts for a while but didn’t do much.

Whenever I’m having anxiety I acknowledge it like: “I feel anxious right now, and that’s okay”

You train your brain not to see it as a threat if not you’re gonna have more if you see it as dangerous! If you try to get rid of repeating white elephant in your brain you’ll do it even more lol 🤣.

2 is allowing it, it’s okay to feel that way especially in today’s day and world. 

Try asking for more, so with anxiety or a panic attack or something fearful, if you charge at it rather than back down it actually goes away. You wouldn’t ask for more of something that’s scary if you don’t want so your brain starts to see it as safe. (It’s scary at first, but you’ll actually notice that running towards it tells your brain you’re safe and it’s okay)

After this engage in something, so like ice your face, go for a walk, or do something that takes your attention away, this is to shift your attention. Like if you ever get lost in time and have no thoughts it’s kinda meditative.

Anyways hope this helps someone!!!

I had a panic attack last night! My first one since March. It definitely caught me by surprise- seems like it came out of nowhere. I stood up, felt a little dizzy, and that triggered an attack. Suddenly I felt like nothing was familiar, I felt very scared, my chest was very tight. My brain kept repeating “something is wrong. Something is wrong.” I was essentially freaking out in a matter of 2 minutes. 

So then, I did nothing. I took some deep breaths and said “okay, well, panic is here. What else can I focus on while my body dumps all this adrenaline out?” I let my partner know that I was feeling some high anxiety but I knew I’d be okay, I just had to ride it out. The adrenaline was making my body feel crazy- but I knew it was just that. Adrenaline.

I did some full body stretches and then just sat down and read a book. It took a little bit before my body returned to baseline. But it did. And that’s what I’ve learned over my 5 year anxiety journey- your body always returns to baseline. I was able to sleep through the night just fine, get up, make my coffee and reflect back on last night. Yes, it sucked. Yes, it isn’t fun and it is scary. Yes, my brain is slightly worried that I’m going to spiral back into panic attacks 24/7. My body may even feel weird and unfamiliar for the next few days!! But I don’t let anxiety dictate my life anymore. I’m not making my decisions based on anxiety anymore. I hope anyone else dealing with panic attacks and anxiety can keep moving forward and know that you will always be okay. Acceptance is the way forward!

But before Klonopin, I was miserable.  I worry about my health day and night. I would not be able to go anywhere alone.  I was too scared to talk to people. I worried about every single thing. I tried SSRIs before that.  I was on them for 10 years.  All they did was make me gain 50 pounds and make me have more panic attacks.  I am currently on 0.5 once a day.  I only take a little more when I am having panic, or when I have to travel to somewhere new alone.  

  
I know, you are not supposed to be on them long term, but what is the alternative? I have done CBT, many coping skills, and other meds.  I would rather have quality over quantity.  I am divorced, have no friends, and life is just at a standstill.  I am simply existing.  

  
If someone else feels like me, I hope this brings some comfort to you.  You are not alone.  I miss how life once was. I hope to find solace again.  

  
Take care.  ",22-08-2025 21:21,22,48

I had been largely asymptomatic for nearly ten years, with the occasional small flare-up that I could mentally squash down within minutes. But now it’s back. It has returned in an unfamiliar form and I no longer know how to deal with the panic and adrenaline that’s racing through my nervous system. Truthfully, I have yet to fully convince myself it concerns anxiety at all.
I suppose I’m posting this to find some sort of assurance that people have experienced a similar development.

I started experiencing panic attacks during my freshman year in university. I experienced some of the most common symptoms like an increased heart rate, palpitations, sweating, difficulty breathing and an upset stomach. I would barely sleep because I feared I would not wake up again. 
I found no support among family or friends. The few healthcare professionals I saw during that time were quick to dismiss my concerns and immediately diagnosed it as anxiety. I suppose that, in time, I learned to mirror their indifference. Slowly I started being able to live my life again.

About four months ago my personal and professional life were impacted negatively. Up until two weeks ago I could handle the added stress. I was struggling but still functioning. Since then I have developed some symptoms which are unfamiliar, while all of my old symptoms are absent. Seriously, who has a panic attack whilst rocking a steady 58 bpm heart rate? I now fear this does not concern anxiety at all but something far more serious. I have been dealing with brain fog, numbness and tingling in my limbs (mostly on the left), muscle tension and weakness. Last week I visited my GP to address my concerns. She suggested testing for hypothyroidism. However, she also asked me to look out for general loss of strength, since this could signal a neurological issue. I’ve been spiraling and barely sleeping ever since.",21-08-2025 21:49,21,12

They take so much of my brain power that I can't focus on the anxious thoughts in my head as much and so I'm distracted.

Being distracted like that helps relieve a lot of the physical symptoms of my panic (the breathing, the pit in my stomach, the heat, etc) which makes the anxiety feel better. 

I'm wondering if anyone else games like these that help? Maybe if others find this tip useful we could get a thread going of game suggestions? ",19-08-2025 21:30,22,40

For example, when I think I’m going to be asked to speak in front of people and when I feel I will be ‘trapped’ somewhere, such as in a work meeting or presentation, or being asked to go on a long car journey with people at work. 

I rarely get anxiety outside of this anymore other than the random panic attack or general anxiety.

Because it doesn’t happen all the time I have never medicated but when something does come around that I can’t avoid, it can be really bad. I dread it coming for weeks and then I’m always really unwell on the day. It gives me bad stomach ache, leading to diarrhoea, heart palpitations, panic attacks and I usually have to leave wherever I am.  For example, I’ve gone to a networking event before and as soon as I realised we would have to speak in front of everyone I ran out and left. 

I have something happening at work next week and I can already feel the anxiety dread beginning. I hate feeling like this and wonder whether I should try medication but is it worth it when I’m not affected all the time by anxiety? 


EDIT: Thank you for all your responses. I have called my doctor and she has prescribed me with some propranolol to help. I feel much better to have this as an option to help me on bad days and I probably wouldn’t have gone for it if it wasn’t for all your comments so thank you.   ",19-08-2025 11:21,23,46

At the height of my anxiety, I had a borderline-OCD routine designed to “manage” it. I took 10 different supplements daily, practiced multiple breathing techniques, carried gadgets in case I got anxious, stuck to a rigid sleep schedule, and obsessed over my diet. I thought all of this was helping; but in reality, it was keeping me stuck.

These kinds of coping mechanisms; supplements, ice packs, breathing tricks, perfect routines; may provide temporary relief, but they often send the wrong message to your brain: *that anxiety is dangerous and must be avoided at all costs.*

The truth is, anxiety is just your body doing what it thinks is necessary. It’s not a threat. And you don’t need to ""fix"" it with a long list of tools or rituals.

The real breakthrough comes when you stop trying to *get rid* of anxiety and start letting it be there. Feel it. Allow it. The fewer crutches you rely on, the faster your brain learns there’s actually nothing to fear.

It might feel counterintuitive at first, but this shift can change everything.",16-08-2025 14:58,22,2

I had a break between them for one or two days, and then it’s right back to the torturous waves of anxiety, nausea, shortness of breath, weakness, rapid heartbeat, chest pains, tightness, dizziness and lightheadedness, etc etc. have never felt this in my entire life, and I feel like I’m actually going insane. Not sure at all what could be causing it, but I’ve gone to the hospital twice this past week because of it and they’ve done all the heart tests, blood tests, nothing wrong. 

Part of me thinks it’s my birth control. I’ve changed it three times for different reasons, and it’s nearly my third month of this third brand, Tricira Lo, and consequently, it’s the same time I’m feeling this horrible. I switched back to the second one I was on because it seems to be the best although it had some flaws, but I’m dreading the thought that it could take months to get back to normal again. 

Genuinely don’t know what to do about this. I’ve tried meditation, can’t even focus on it because of the racing thoughts and waves of anxiety. I’ve taken Clonazepam twice, it helped a little, but my doctor told me it’s not good to take too often. I’m too scared to go on daily anxiety meds because I have terrible health anxiety, and I have peers all around me telling me how bad medication is and that I could become an addict. I have my first therapist appointment tomorrow, hopefully that can help somewhat but not sure.

On the drive home from my final shift I remember feeling like this massive weight was just lifted off my shoulders and like I could finally breathe. I used to think that even though I knew my job sucked, that management and customers both treated me like garbage, that ""it was just a job"" and ""nobody likes working"" but if I had to quantify it I would say my anxiety has decreased by AT LEAST 70%. Obviously working is always gonna be hard for people with anxiety, but it is possible to have a job (even an entry level one) that doesn't make you actively hate yourself and hate your life.

I took up drinking not long after I started there to cope with how stressed out it made me, and took up smoking literally just as an excuse to get extra breaks. I would have had a lot more saved if I didn't blow half of it on alcohol. But also alcohol was at times the only thing that was getting me through the week. In retrospect, I wish I had just thugged it out for like a year and then used those savings to get trained in something better but oh well. Thankfully my drinking never got *too* out of control so I did still have some savings left over toward the end.

I know that not everybody is in a good position to just up and quit their job, I'm lucky to have received a grant to go to college and to have a dad who works a good job and can support me. My college offers a ton of recourses for people with anxiety and all my instructors are great, *it was genuinely disorienting to have so much freedom, and to be around people who won't scream at me for making a tiny mistake, or make fun of me.*

I know I'm in a very privileged position compared to a lot of other people who work crappy jobs, but please, if you have ***any*** avenue out please take it.",09-09-2025 18:50,21,0

When I was a kid, I got bullied a lot in school. My mom was very protective and always told me not to fight back or speak up because she didn’t want me to cause problems. So I stayed quiet, swallowed it, and just took it.

Somewhere along the way I developed these “survival strategies” that kept me safe back then, but now they’re ruining my adult life:

I act like a clown/self-deprecating so people don’t see me as a threat.

I purposely act weak/harmless so no one targets me.

Whenever things got bad as a kid, I’d go to sleep, and when I woke up it felt like the problem was gone. I still do that now — I literally sleep to escape racing thoughts.

I avoid conflict because I’m scared I’ll snap and get violent (even though i am faaar from a violent person), so I bottle everything.


Now as an adult, it shows up like this:

Constant racing “what if” thoughts, especially about how people see me.

Obsessing over uncertainty until it makes me physically sick (headaches).

Feeling like there’s a hole in my chest when I can’t control the outcome.

Sleeping during the day whenever i can just to shut my brain off.

Acting awkward or fake in social situations because I don’t know how to just be myself.


It feels like I’m still living as that kid who needed to survive. I logically know I’m safe now, but my body/mind don’t act like it.

I guess my questions are:

1. Does this sound familiar to anyone else?


2. How do you break out of these survival strategies and actually learn to live like a normal person?


3. What’s helped you long-term when you felt like a slave to your thoughts?

I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2022 by my therapist. Then I decided to go on medication, and this whole process was confusing and embarrassing

I was also in a relationship and was worried that I wouldn’t contribute since I have a mental disability 

The next year I worked for 3 different companies in the span of 9 months. I worked in HR, which I now realize is not a good job for an ADHD person

I made too many mistakes, rushed through completing important documents, etc. 

After I got laid off from the third job, I developed an anxiety disorder. Everything became more difficult, I stopped listening to music in the morning because I didn’t want to put my ear buds on

The anxiety lasted for a while, and I wondered if I would ever feel normal again

I started doing therapy once a week and eventually found another job in HR

At the end of 2024, my anxiety went away. My guess is it was a combination of doing therapy, listening to the anxiety podcast, and making little adjustments every day

I began developing confidence, and I could tell that people enjoyed talking to me at parties which was nice

Fast-forward to August 2025, and I’m really enjoying my life. I’m recently single and got out of a 7 year relationship. Im glad to be out of it, my ex put her hands on me and became really controlling

When I look at my life, I’m having fun and meeting lots of people. I rarely get anxious, but when I do, I use the tools I developed in therapy to ground myself

Then this person came into the store to yell at me in person so I asked someone to deal with him it didn’t do any good for me to speak to him since he was just gonna yell at me. He kept speaking badly about me then said ‘fucking bitch’ as he left. My boss however said because he said it as he left and not while looking at me it doesn’t count? 

I actually already quit this job a month ago and had a week left to work. I guess when it happened I was like well at least I just have a week left so whatever. After my lunch break my boss said he wanted to talk to me. I explained my side of the situation but he said since I lost my patience with this person, he thinks my mind is just elsewhere and I might lose patience with more people. So he said he’s going to pay me for the rest of the week but I can go home now. I was like so I’m getting fired? And he said no since I already quit, we’re not on bad terms or anything its just best for me to leave now. I was like, I’ve never even had a warning, theres never been a complaint about my service before. He said that if I had not quit it would be another discussion but for now his trust is broken and he doesn’t trust me to give my all for the rest of the week.

I feel sick, I feel like throwing up, crying, dying. I’ve had one other job do this to me. I quit and they said no need to finish the week just go home because I was too negative, this was during a huge mental breakdown. But since I’ve been medicated I thought things like this wouldnt happen anymore. Im so mad at myself. I guess he is right, I never hung up on anyone before even if they yelled at me. Clearly a part of me was thinking ‘im leaving anyway’. Im feeling really embarrassed and disgusted and just every bad emotion. I’m really shocked he sent me home for one bad call. But he’s right, why try to ‘resolve the issue’ if im leaving anyway. At least im getting paid. I feel like taking an appointment with my doctor because I feel so bad, but maybe I’ll feel better later ",26-08-2025 19:53,19,37

I got a clean bill of health, which was awesome because I was worried about other health things like my weight.

But I have not felt right since that panic attack. I'll have random triggers that don't make sense....I stepped and my ankle felt weird = panic attack. I ate food and got a stomach ache = panic attack. I roll my shoulder to stretch it = panic attack

And I swear, if I eat a big meal, or think too hard, I have this constant remaining pain on my left chest just above the bottom part of my ribs, which then radiates to my shoulder and chin because, you guessed it, panic attack...

All of the symptoms go away when im doing something. Playing games/working/walking. But any other time just is ruined right now for me. Even sleeping feels like a gamble...sometimes I can breathe, sometimes I can't so I toss and turn.

The worst part is I never had anxiety issues before this panic attack... did I really just mess myself up to make this the new norm? Or is it just the symptoms of what I've heard ""panic attack hangover"".

My anxiety has been bad lately, but not in a traditional sense. Instead I have physical symptoms that pop up out of NOWHERE. Like the other night I was writing a paper for school when suddenly the screen went kind of blurry and my heart started pounding. I checked my pulse and it was way higher than usual. There is absolutely no trigger for this, it just happened. Of course I thought I was having a heart attack. I was not. 

Then today my legs went numb and my feet were tingly. I felt weak and exhausted. I took my as needed anxiety medication (vistaril, it really does work even tho it's basically just benadryl) and it went away.

I just don't understand how anxiety can cause such a wide variety of symptoms, especially out of the damn blue! Numbness is a big one for me. I'll feel numb on one side of my body. For the fake heart attack, I had chest pain, shoulder and arm pain, and dizziness. Again, there is absolutely nothing wrong with me. It's just crazy!

Then there'll be waiting to get test results to see if anything stands out as the cause... then waiting to see if any potential solutions help... In the meantime life is hell.

I'll start from the very beginning. About a month ago (July 27th) as I was getting ready to go to bed a bit later than usual I felt really strange. that ""something feels off"" feeling where you're looking at your hands and arms knowing something isn't quite right but you aren't sure what. At the same time my lips got really tingly. Trying to go to sleep that night I kept getting jerked awake right as I was about to fall asleep, not from thinking I was falling but by some zap in my head. Not quite sure how to explain it or if anyone knows what I mean. I'm not sure if this event is related but I mentioned it anyways. I did nothing out of the ordinary that day that I could think of.

Fast forward to the following day, evening around 7 I think. I'm editing a photo for a thumbnail like I've done dozens of times before. Nothing I've done out of that day was out of the ordinary, but INSTANTLY. Panic came out of nowhere. I've had panic attacks before, the fear, the heart racing, the ""I need to GO"" feeling. But nothing, and I mean NOTHING like this, and never so fast from nothing. It started with the wave up the back of my head, I quickly got up to take something and try to lie down but before I could do anything it was too late. My heart felt like it was going to explode, I couldn't breathe, EVERYTHING was tingling pins and needles, my body told me I had to GO AND GO NOW. It was too much, too fast, within 60 seconds of it starting I made the call that we need to go to a hospital. The way there was the longest time of my life as it somehow got worse, and worse, and I have never, EVER felt more like I was going to die (even more than the time I actually WAS at risk of dying). I was hoping going/getting to the hospital would calm me down by making me feel safer but nope. For some reason doing that or trying to do anything to calm down makes me ""admit"" it's bad and makes it escalate. All the tests they ran/EKG all that came back normal... or at least reasonable for the state I was in. They gave me something, and after a bit it eventually ended. I went home, and went to bed. Again, NOTHING out of the ordinary that day that I could think of. and I've been wracking my brain trying to think of anything it could be.

And since then it's been torture. I think something finally snapped, I don't know how, I don't know why, but suddenly I'm broken. anything small sets me off to where I have to calm down. I can't eat as much anymore because it raises my heartrate, I can't be annoyed, antsy, excited or worked up in any way or it escalates. Any reasonable limiter I had on how frustrated I could be with something is gone. Having the vacuum running for maybe 1-2 min in the other room was too much for me. being in the car is too much for me because there's a lot going on but somehow stopping the car is WORSE as all the sound and vibration is instantly sucked away. I tried to go to my parents this last monday and the way there was torture, stopping the car was some of the worst I've felt in a long time. I took 30 min to calm down and go inside and couldn't last 30seconds before I had to exit and spend another 20 calming down in order to go home (and basically every day I've been taking xanax to survive typically .25-1mg range depending how bad things are). So after that whole Ideal I realized I'm trapped at my apartment.

I feel silly saying it but I am 100% traumatized by that first panic attack and as I realize I'm more and more hopeless it gets worse. But I also feel like in addition to that something is still wrong in my body that's causing this. Because going out I figured once I acknowledged and dealt with the reasons I was worried about leaving the apartment I would be fine. But nope, I no longer have control over my mind or body, and realizing that was terrifying. It's frustrating, it's annoying, I can sit there and logically tell myself everything is fine, even feel bored of the scenario of having to sit there and fight for my life trying to calm down but my body just keeps trucking along anyways.

I've seen my psych and had meds prescribed to try that I'm just FINALLY getting. But I almost don't want to try them in the desperate hope that tests will find SOMETHING wrong with me that's causing this, and then I'll be able to feel myself getting better once that issue is solved without needing the extra meds. But at the same time I've never felt worse in my life.

I'm so foggy because at any given moment 30% of my mind is being used scanning and being on the lookout for signs of panic so it doesn't come out of nowhere like the first one. Even though I know there were no signs to react to. Which is part of what makes it scariest. I didn't get to feel anything until it was too late. No time to fight back or anything, so no matter how good I feel it could always, always happen again. I keep thinking, searching, and BEGGING for something to stand out as the cause but there's nothing. I went from fine to broken in an instant. I've had life stressors for a while now but there's no way it manifested that instantly, that intensely and completely snapped me this hard. I can point to a day, and a time, that I snapped, and that my ability to exist in peace was shattered. For no reason.

Medications, counseling, psychiatrists, etc. That helped, then moved more into meditation, being more self aware, analyzing my body, and that was even more helpful. 

Now the problem:

I feel I have a really good grasp of my anxiety at this point in my life. The one thing I just cannot figure out a solution to is the following sensation and I’ll try to describe.
(I’ve had heart palpitations, I’ve had IBS, I’ve had all the typical
Symptoms that are associated with anxiety, it’s not any of these things)

It’s a slight pressure/contraction that can be centered anywhere as high as where my chin naturally touches my chest if I look down, and as wide as the exterior of both left and right pecks. 

it seems to radiate both a tingling sensation and a hint of coldness, but my body seems to identify it as “wrong” somehow? It doesn’t hurt at all. And it’s almost an identical sensation everytime it just changes location of where I feel it each time it happens. 

Like I have experienced plenty of sensations being a hypersensitive and overly worried human being that has struggled with anxiety for a long time. 

But this isn’t that. 

It also almost ALWAYS begins BEFORE my anxiety. For the past 3-5 years as my anxiety has gotten wonderfully better, this physical sensation of wrongness now just randomly begins and I have to fight my brain to not start telling itself I’m having anxiety. 

It can happen anytime anywhere and it happens often when I feel very calm and have no worries at that moment, and then of course I have to fight not to let it trigger my anxiety. 

Pretty much stuck with “it’s your subconscious stress physically manifesting, and that is completely useless because I’m looking to be proactive and find solutions! 

Does anyone else have their anxiety almost entirely triggered by what feels like the exact same feeling every time but in different areas of my chest and upper abdomen???

What did you do that helped you?


TLDR: Does anyone who has successfully dealt with their anxiety for a long time have a physical “wrongness” sensation in their chest that triggers their anxiety? It can happen when you’re completely relaxed and have nothing stressing you out? Subconscious stress physically manifesting is the only answer I’ve ever gotten that I can’t really prove or disprove.

In the last couple of days it’s got much worse. I find myself thinking I just want to keep him inside me because that feels like the only way I can keep him safe. 

Just for context: I am diagnosed with GAD and SAD. My anxiety was pretty manageable while I was on ADHD meds (idk why that helped, but it did). Since I got pregnant and had to come off ADHD meds, it just feels like it's getting worse as my pregnancy progresses. Sometimes I can't tell if it's my motherly protective instinct or if it's irrational anxiety. 

For context, I currently live with my MIL, her husband, and her two kids (8 and 10). This all really started when my MIL bluntly told me: *“*Don’t put your baby into nursery when you go back to work, I want to look after him.”

The problem is, I do not trust her childcare. I’ve seen things with my own eyes that make me feel sick to imagine happening to my baby. For example:

* She once left her 8-month-old nephew unattended and he crawled up the stairs and fell from the top step.
* She also let her 8-year-old son run around with her newborn nephew on his shoulders, swinging him about.

I can’t shake the anxiety that this is exactly the kind of thing that could happen to my own baby if I wasn’t around. I’ve told my mum how I feel, but she brushed it off and said: “She won’t do that with her grandchild, she’ll love him more.” But surely she loves her nephew too and she still let that happen?

This turned into an argument because I said I will not be leaving my baby with my MIL, my mum said I was being ungrateful because I wasn't taking her advice and if she was in my position she would work all day and leave her kid at home with her MIL. I told her my plan is to cut my working hours down to 3 days a week after maternity leave so that on the other days he’s not in nursery, I can be there myself and she basically said that this was a stupid decision and I was being arrogant. This is another reason why I am doubting whether it's genuine anxiety or not. I generally trust my mum's advice, but she seems to think I need to sacrifice my wellbeing to keep other people happy. I can't tell if it's one of those moments now or just anxiety. 

I’m being made to feel like I’m overreacting, but how am I supposed to stop feeling anxious when I’ve literally seen her do these unsafe things? I just feel desperately anxious and overwhelmed. I want to keep my baby safe, but I feel like nobody is really listening.",09-09-2025 11:17,17,28

But I had to stop the propranolol, and the hydroxyzine and those were the two I was currently taking, due to me being pregnant and they were potentially causing growth issues with the baby. I completely stopped taking them for 2 months while also dealing with very anxiety provoking issues with my pregnancy. Now I can take them like once a week if needed.

Yesterday I finally saw a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Talking to him started to make everything I have felt make sense. I was super anxious leading up to the appointment, had a minor panic attack waiting for it to start, but as soon as I started talking to him I felt a huge wave of relief. 

I am starting out with Buspar twice a day, and Prozac. I was on lexapro originally 2 years ago but stopped because I thought I was better, he explained to me stopping usually makes it worse. 

Today is much better for me, last night was the first night I went to sleep without a panic attack. I am facing some mild chest tightness (almost like a muscle pull) and nausea, but I am assuming the nausea is from starting the new medication.

***1. Being thankful to my anxiety***  
I usually read a lot of anxiety self-help books and listen to podcasts. In one of them, I learned how humor could be a tool, like noticing anxious thoughts without judgment and saying, *“Oh, here you go again, anxiety! How are you doing today?”* But honestly, that didn’t really help me. I assume it’s not my style.

What did stick with me from another book was the idea that anxiety actually helped humans survive. Back in the early days, when we didn’t have safety or protection, overthinking acted like a safety net; and it worked! we survived! We just don’t need it as much now.

So, combining the two, I figured out that instead of humor, it helps me to thank my anxiety. I’ll say, *“Hey anxiety, thank you for helping me when I needed it. I think I can handle it today, but I’ll call you again if I need you.”* If I’m alone, I whisper it. If I’m in public, I just say it silently a few times. Somehow, it works for me.

***2. Journaling what I’m not anxious about***  
I read through a lot of posts here and in other groups and notice the things people feel anxious about that don’t really trigger me. I started keeping a spreadsheet, writing down how that person feels and how I don’t relate to it. That helps me realize that when I have my own anxious streak, it might not make sense to others either, and that reminder helps me step back.

It’s a tedious process and took me about 8 months of regular journaling before it really started helping. For example, I don’t have health anxiety at all, even though I’ve had multiple surgeries in my life (one just last year). For some reason, I’m okay with it. So when I see people posting about health anxiety, I remind myself to notice the things I *don’t* get anxious about.

I have no medical or psychiatric background! These are just personal experiences that have been working for me.",23-08-2025 04:55,16,1

I started escitalopram at 10mg just over two weeks ago, and my life has fucking changed. 

I used to be constantly anxious (in ways i didn't even realize until just now) and I'd have panic attacks way too often to function, and mild anxiety attacks like every few days if not every damn day. It was like a rinse and repeat cycle where I felt like shit 24/7, but like varying levels of shit, if that makes sense. 
As in I would be constantly anxious, and would just be waiting for it to get bad enough for me to lose it and panic myself down to just simmering under the edge again. Like I could only blow just enough steam at a time to not go insane. 

But it's just, gone. Like that. I've still had a few panic attacks here and there, and my intrusive thoughts are still just as prominent. But I can BREATHE. Like, actually breathe. IN DEEP BREATHS!!! I can't ever remember a time where I could do this so easily, if ever. I've been anxious my whole life, and have never been able to relax, so this is fucking crazy to me. I'm still revelling in the relief I feel. 

For the first week it sucked though because it felt weird to not be so anxious anymore, it was downright freaky. But oh my god it feels like I'm starting to accept it??? That's okay???? What the hell????? 😭

Obviously medications won't be right for everyone, and sometimes they suck (I myself have had a few downsides to the meds) but it's all worth it to find your dose. To find what makes your life easier to live. 

TL;DR I started anxiety medication and am feeling fan-fucking-tastic. Jazz hands level excitement.",21-08-2025 09:49,18,5

What if I’m dismissing something as “anxiety” but in reality it’s my brain trying to prepare me in a rational manner? 

I think about this often. I have a mathematical brain, and I hold degrees in math—I rely on logic and facts but am sensible enough to know when my feelings should take the wheel. Yet the only thing that I can never mathematize is my thoughts. I can rely on statistics and trust it enough to be able to conclude solid results without worry… but when it comes to my thoughts, all my reasoning and thinking skills drop. “Oh! Something has a .001% of being true? It still has a chance of being true, so it’s not worth dismissing. I need to overthink this.”

In today’s diagnosis-driven culture, it’s easy to forget that anxiety is actually your body doing exactly what it’s designed to do.

When your body perceives a threat, the anxiety response kicks in; it’s your system’s way of getting your attention through physical sensations or racing thoughts. A big challenge comes when we start fearing the anxiety itself. That fear loop can make it feel like anxiety is showing up “for no reason.”

The key is not to fight or shame yourself, but to gradually teach your anxious brain that it’s safe. That the threat it’s warning you about isn’t harmful. You are not broken or unfixable. You’re simply learning how to reassure your system and remind it that it doesn’t always need to sound the alarm.",17-08-2025 19:35,15,3

I connect with men over dating apps, the initial conversation is fine but as soon as we agree to a date my anxiety kicks in. I have bouts of extreme anxiety leading up to the date and then after if we agree to see each other again. I feel this intense uncomfortability with all of it and this pressure that I’m not sure why is there. Ive never met a horrible person or had a terrible experience either but I don’t want to see them and try to avoid going on more dates, even if I like them. 

The anxiety just builds after the first date until I can’t handle it anymore and break it off. I’ve never got past a 3rd date. I tried a casual approach thinking that might feel less pressured but that didn’t work. As soon as I break things off it feels like this pressure release and I can feel like normal again. 

I kept trying thinking I just needed exposure therapy but the anxiety has got worse. I’ve been going to therapy and recently switched my meds and it’s still so bad. I’m really at a loss for what to do. It feels like I’ll never be able to have a relationship at this point. ",11-09-2025 01:14,13,12

My days are consumed by health anxiety. I keep spiraling whenever I take my blood pressure..if it spikes, I panic. If it goes “too low” (like 100/66, which I know is actually normal), I panic even more.

I check my BP and heart rate constantly, and every number feels like a verdict on whether I’m okay or in danger. On top of that, I find myself checking my pulse on my neck almost every minute, like I can’t stop. Even when my vitals are completely fine, my brain keeps telling me something is wrong. It’s exhausting.

I also have panic attacks, where I feel my heart pounding, can’t breathe properly, and convince myself I’m about to die. Rationally, I know it’s anxiety, but in the moment it feels so real that I can’t calm down.

Living like this is tiresome. I feel stuck in this loop of fear and checking, and it’s eating away at my energy and peace of mind.

My dream is to go to university and study nursing. I believe education is my right, and I want to build a future where I can help people and also stand on my own feet.

But my mom doesn’t see it this way. She keeps telling me I should just get a job so that I “look successful” in front of others. She constantly compares me to our neighbor’s son, who is younger than me. He works a tough job where he stands under the sun all day without sitting, and she acts like that makes him better than me.

What hurts the most is when she says things like, “I have no hope in you.” Those words cut deep. I already struggle with health issues that make standing in the sun or working long hours dangerous for me. Most of the jobs here are 12 hours a day for only around 290 JOD ($410) a month, with just 4 days off. It’s exploitation, not a future. Even if I forced myself into that, it wouldn’t give me real growth or stability.

I’m not lazy. I’m learning, I’m trying, I want to study nursing and make something out of myself. But no matter what I do, my mom only sees me as a failure because I don’t bring money home right now.

I think one of the worst things a man can experience is constant comparison. And when that comparison comes from your own mother, it feels ten times worse. It makes me feel like nothing I do will ever be enough.

I(17F) posted about this plenty of times before, and I guess I have been feeding the anxiety by posting and googling about it. Right now, I don’t feel real at all—I feel very faint. Three hours ago I woke up with clammy hands, and a fast heart rate that was worsening whenever I sat up and stood up. My face felt hot but I didnt feel like I was having a fever or anything. My skin just felt extremely warm. 

I panicked, called my mom, she started yelling at me which made things worse. I told her about these symptoms last night and she told me it was anxiety and said that if I didnt take my meds she’ll just admit me into a mental hospital—which also worsened my anxiety. 

This morning, I ended up calling the ambulance cause I felt like I was going to faint. EMS stayed with me, took my BP, checked my pulse/heart rate. Said it was high but not dangerous and could be elevated because I’m scared. They took me to the hospital, and now im here getting blood tests, chest X-rays, got an EKG, and gave them some urine. I feel super embarrassed, severely anxious, and I feel like I’m driving myself insane.

I am TERRIFIED of medications so taking my prozac and Hydroxyzine(Take as needed) is something I CANNOT physically do. Im scared of side effects—terribly scared. What if I hallucinate? What if I die? What if it hurts my heart? All those symptoms sound FAR too close to weed.

I know medicine and recreational drugs arent the same but I had a bad experience with being given a edible without my consent in school. The school blamed me for it and my friends turned against me and that was just the worst week of my life. Now I associate any kind of drugs and school with that experience and I just physically cant go to school anymore or take medicine. Even tylenol and ibuprofen scares me.

I had high cholesterol and idk if I still do, im waiting for my blood tests. I heard that certain drugs can cause heart issues if you had them in the past. Im scared of that. I feel so stupid. I feel so sick. I feel like im dying and not real. I want my mommy but she’s upset at me for calling 911 so much for stuff like this. And I cant call my dad at the moment, he’s incarcerated which leaves me with no one.

I feel hurt. I feel stuck. I feel lonely. I feel terrified of nothing but everything at the same time. I want control of my life back and I feel like thats never going to happen. I feel insane. 

This was mostly me ranting but I would like some advice. I rather not be diagnosed or given “medical advice” since that’ll worsen my anxiety and its also not allowed on here. But I would like to know what to do. I feel so alone right now. I feel like everyone has turned against me . I feel like I’m stuck.

TD;LR: Called 911 because of distressing physical symptoms. Currently in the hospital waiting for results. I am terrified of my medication for my anxiety because of bad past experiences. I feel lonely, crazy, and embarrassed. I don’t think its going to get better if I stay off medication but I dont know HOW to NOT feel scared about side effects. Any advice?",05-09-2025 18:39,14,7

I have had therapists tell me to just put the firehose down as there is no fire to put out, with explaining anything on how the hell I do that.

For anyone struggling I would really recommend searching for therapist that goes the route of mindfulness and acceptance. Some of the CBT crap that gets taught is really not the most helpful and all these coping strategies can backfire in the long run.

TW!!!!!,"Sooo a little over 3 weeks ago, I was prescribed 10mg citalopram (celexa), 25mg seroquel for 3 nights and then as needed (for sleep), and 0.25mg xanax as needed. 

I was having a really rough time in July. My OCD & anxiety had been spiraling and was making my life a living hell. I lost 14 pounds in 2 weeks, was 2 weeks late for my period, and was barely sleeping (like barely). I was crying 24/7. I was so scared all the time for absolutely no reason. I was shaky all the time. I couldn’t leave the house. Hell, I couldn’t even go to work without crying because I was scared to be alone. 

I have, what my parents and I like to call “episodes” when I’m mentally not doing so good. These “episodes” consist of pure, violent rage. I’m not violent towards others, only towards myself and whatever I can break. In the past, I’ve had bruised eyelids from punching myself, scratches on my face from clawing myself, and bruised knuckles from punching walls. However, this last episode was the reason why I decided to talk with my doctor about antidepressants. This was the worst one of all. I have these metal knobs on my bathroom cabinets. I was sitting on the floor, crying, with my mom next to me, trying to calm me down. I started kicking my feet and ruined the crown molding. And then, I started banging my head back on the cabinet. I just didn’t know the metal knob was right behind my head. During these “episodes,” I never know what the damage is until after I work it out of my system. I don’t feel pain at all because my adrenaline is so high. I remember my mom’s face while I was banging my head back. She was petrified. When I stopped, I realized that I had broken the metal knob in half with the sharp piece facing upwards and if I would’ve thrown my head back anymore, I don’t know what would have happened. It wouldn’t have been good. When I checked the back of my head, it was bleeding. There was blood in my hair. I didn’t know if I had to go to an urgent care or not because my mom and I were scared to look. My mom finally was able to look and thank God, it was only a small scratch. 

I vowed to God, myself, and my parents that I would never let myself ever get worked up like that ever again. It was traumatizing. It shook me deep in my core. 

Because of the fear I felt after I realized what I had done, it was in that moment that I knew; I wanted to live, no matter what hardships I’ve faced/ will face.

My diagnoses were: major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and insomnia. I didn’t go much into detail about my obsessive compulsive disorder though. I wish I would’ve, but she knows I have it, especially because my therapist is in the same office as her and my therapist knows allll about it. It’s just kind of personal to talk about. I also mentioned to my doctor about how I turn into an absolute monster about a week or two before my period. 

Anyways, It’s only been a little over 3 weeks since I started taking citalopram. However, it feels quieter in my mind. I’ve always been a people person, but as of late, it’s been incredibly easy to talk to literally anybody. I do find myself still checking things (ocd, random things), but I don’t think it’s as bad anymore. 

My biggest milestone has been eating alone at a restaurant. I never thought I’d do that in the 22 years I’ve been alive, but I did. I seriously would have NEVER done that. If someone told me 6 months, a year, 2 years ago, I’d do that, I would have never believed them. 

I saw my doctor yesterday to go over blood test results and for her to see how I was doing. From what we discussed, she wants to keep me on 10mg for now, but I see her in another 4 weeks because I filled out a mental health paper where you tally up the scores and she said, “we can definitely do better.” My whole life I’ve always felt overstimulated, but now, it’s like I don’t feel stimulated. I’ve had too much time on my hands because the job I have right now isn’t consistent. So, I’ve been actively trying to find a job that’s going to give me a consistent routine. 

So, my doctor wants to check back with me in 4 weeks to see if I’ve improved because I will definitely have a job by then. If not, she wants to up my dosage. 

I know it hasn’t been that long since I’ve been taking citalopram and normally it takes 4-6 weeks to feel the full effects, but I’m doing better. 

I just wanted to share my story in case anyone out there has gone through/ or is going through the same thing. You are not alone, stranger(s) ❤️ We all need a little help sometimes, whatever that help may be! (as long as it’s healthy) 🫶🏻",05-09-2025 05:07,13,1

I kicked its ass, and then it came right back. We have been assailed by tons of other losses and difficulties (finances, kid problems, housing disasters, job loss, family illness.) I got him into ketamine treatment a year ago. It helped a lot with his depression and anxiety. But now it appears to be back. He is always hypervigilant and can’t rest well. 

But he hates meds. He works out constantly and is a body builder. He is afraid of weight gain, loss of libido (although ironically he is too anxious and stressed to have sex.) I have tried everything natural under the sun. Meditation works great for a few minutes. CBD helps his body relax but not his racing thoughts. Nothing helps. He seems so distressed all of the time I’m afraid I’m going to lose him. I can’t seem to make him think it’s ok to do what he needs to and take what he needs.

I’m a 21 year old female who has been living with Generalized Anxiety Disorder since I was 12. When I was younger, I was in therapy and on medication, but right now I can’t afford either option.

Over the past year, I have noticed my anxiety beginning to make my life increasingly difficult and unnecessarily stressful. In my fourth semester of college, my grades took a significant hit due to procrastination and just an overall fear of not performing well enough. My “solution” ended up being to not turn in assignments or skip class entirely. Every time I did write a paper, I was consumed with the fear that my professors would accuse me of using artificial intelligence like ChatGPT, even though all of my work was my own. I ended up withdrawing from a course and finished the semester with mostly C’s, when I’m usually an A–B student. Not too bad, but not where I wanted my grades to be.

It was fine for a while over the summer where I had virtually nothing to do. I spent most of my time either in bed or helping my mom around the house back in my hometown. But during that time, I cut off communication with almost all of my friends, and now I’m pretty much always alone. The only time I speak at all is during my classes when it is required of me. Even then it feels like I'm an alien pretending to be a human and trying to speak for the first time. I think I call my mom way too much, and I think she's getting a little sick of it.

Lately, things have gotten worse. My anxiety has recently caused me to skip a menstrual cycle. I panicked and convinced myself that I could be pregnant, so I literally bought *twenty* pregnancy tests (all negative, understandably, since I haven’t even been in a situation where pregnancy was possible). On top of that, I recently had to complete a background check for a job, and I became so convinced that I must be on some registry or had a warrant out for my arrest (I’ve never committed a crime in my life) that I started doing personal background checks and registry lookups on myself. I felt so silly afterwards. Even now, I keep worrying that I'll accidentally trigger someone over this post, and keep looking back at the rules. 

I have constant tremors and nausea. Most days it feels like I've just run a marathon. My nails are bitten to hell, which has been a problem that I've had since I was very young.

I hate living like this and hate that I can't seem to control it. I wish I could experience life in a way where my anxiety didn’t exist and where my brain wasn’t in constant overdrive. I’ve never known the kind of peace that just allows me to breathe for a second, and sometimes I catch myself wondering how incredible that must feel.",06-09-2025 18:47,13,11

On my way I was approached by a guy (i’ll refer to him as Dee) who recognized me from the recruitment fair earlier that day (it’s basically a huge event where clubs and organizations advertise what they do and try and get people to join). Apparently I had talked to him and tried to recruit him — I talked to hundreds so I didn’t really remember

He asked me more about my club, we realized we had some mutual friends and he started to walk alongside me, then he pointed out a group of people and said something like “wanna meet my friends?” and I was like omg yes because i love making friends, and it’s so hard this day and age. I was so excited bc I was having an extremely bad day and i’m an extrovert so I was like *finally* something good

Then as we were talking I playfully poked fun at a guy in the group for not being able to do tricks on his skateboard, then Dee turns to me and says “if i do a trick on the skate board can i take you on a date?” I told him I have a boyfriend and *everyone* went quiet for a few moments and then started to laugh. Then one of the girls said to me “You can leave if you want.” It felt like I was dismissed so I just left feeling so embarrassed 

I haven’t been able to stop periodically crying today. I just feel like a big joke. I genuinely thought they all wanted to be my friend but i’m such an idiot for thinking that. I knew something was off when I started talking to them, they all seemed so interested in what I had to say but then suddenly they didn’t care and I was dismissed and waved off like i lost all of my value.. I feel like I was the butt of some joke i wasn’t in on and it’s awful, it’s like this mix of horror and humiliation in my chest that won’t go away and i can’t stop shaking and crying. it doesn’t help that my parents have been berating me all day i feel so stupid and worthless and terrified",03-09-2025 04:23,12,7

I just get so weirdly anxious whenever I travel. it stopped me from going places from 13-15, which is heartbreaking. 

thankfully, I forced myself to go places. I went to the beach for the first time in 2022, and went on an overnight school trip to DC in 2023. despite this, I still feel a discomfort going away from home. hell, this year I started dissociating during long bus rides- I think it's from lack of control of the vehicle.

I really want to get over it, but I don't know how. I recently found an internship opportunity a couple of states away, but I got anxious at the thought of taking a long bus ride and living far away from home for a few months.

...which is kinda weird. I'm a queer, Black community college student who lives with an overprotective religious family. I've been bitter these past few weeks because I've been craving space and independence. you'd think I WOULDN'T be anxious, yet here I am.

Went to a concert, saw some friends, had a few drinks…everything was great until I got home. I went to sleep around midnight and woke up around 2am not feeling well. 

I went to the bathroom thinking I was going to be sick or maybe just needed to poop. Sat by the toilet and got incredibly dizzy and started sweating profusely. I lost consciousness and have no idea how long I was out but woke up across the floor. For a second after I woke up I felt fine….then it started all over again. I have never felt this hot and sweaty in my life. 
I crawled into the bathtub and filled it cold water while I continued to pour it over my head and chest. 

I slowly started telling myself this was just a panic attack and focusing on progressive muscle relaxation and that seemed to help control my breathing and dizziness. 
After about 10-15 minutes in the tub I got up, dried off, and went back to bed. I’ve felt completely drained and out of it today. 

I only drank 3 beers over the course of four hours so I know it wasn’t that but I’m trying to pinpoint what would cause me to have a panic attack start in my sleep.

There was a period in my life when anxiety felt like a constant background noise.
Even when nothing was “wrong,” I felt restless inside — like I couldn’t slow my thoughts down.

I’d wake up already tired.
I’d scroll through my phone, hoping for distraction.
I’d push through my day with a tight chest and a mind full of “what-ifs.”

At first, I thought this was just stress from work and life. But over time, I started to notice… anxiety wasn’t just showing up randomly. It was almost like my body was trying to tell me something.

That realization hit me hard:

Maybe the restlessness wasn’t punishment.

Maybe the racing thoughts weren’t weakness.

Maybe they were signals that I needed to slow down and make real changes.

I didn’t fix everything overnight (I wish it were that easy). But that one shift — seeing anxiety as a signal instead of just a problem — was the first step toward actually healing.

I’ll share more about what I did next, but I’m curious…

Has anyone else here felt like their anxiety was more of a messenger than just an enemy?",28-08-2025 16:21,12,2

I’ve been getting strange reactions to sunlight and heat (swollen eyelids, and hands, rashes on my face). I think i definitely have a sun allergy but doctors have been so unhelpful. 

I went to Istanbul last summer and had the worst panic attack in the hotel room. The AC wasn’t working well and it was humid. I felt like I couldn’t breathe and ended up having a panic attack. I threw up after I calmed down.. 

This year I made sure not to go anywhere too hot for a holiday. But I’ve been experiencing anxiety on nights when it gets hot and humid. 
I woke up in the middle of the night feeling hot, and then I get shortness of breath. It’s a horrible feeling.

I also noticed that I’ve started feeling anxious in the cinema 😩I went to watch a movie with my sisters a few days ago and my anxiety started. I felt hot, and couldn’t breathe properly. I went to the bathroom to cool myself down. I ended up going outside the cinema to get some fresh air.

I've been sitting in my bed in the last half an hour I get palpitations in like every 2-3-5 minutes. A few seconds of craziness, then a bit of a break, then palpitations again, then a few minutes calmness, and then again...

My HR is normal.

I have been sick for a few days and my anxiety is higher than the usual high but still... 

The most annoying thing is that I went to a cardiologist last week and he didn't even say anything when I said palpitations are my most concerning symptom. I had a Holter in January, started taking medication for fast HR but that was it.
Now I'm supposed to have another Holter in November to check, but that's all.

In the meantime, here I am, stuck with my scary heart flutters.

Telling myself it's just anxiety doesn't help much. I'm doing the obvious things like breathing and hydrating, etc.

Did anyone find any solutions to this?

I cannot even begin to express how amazing this medication has been in contrast to being unmedicated. ADHD symptoms aside, the depression and mental anxiety feel so much relief when the stimulant is working.

Despite this, the persistent physical anxiety that I’ve battled with for over 8 years hasn’t let up. It’s such a strange sensation, as for the first time my mind is calm and clear. There’s a pretty constant baseline which causes quite the discomfort, and I never really feel relaxed.

It also counteracts some of the therapeutic benefits of the stimulant. It’s very hard to focus properly when there’s a constant chest tightness. I’ve had the very occasional period where these physical symptoms have softened and the stimulant is active, and it is the most peace I have ever felt.

The physical anxiety is actually very stable throughout the day, so where I’d usually have ruminating thoughts which would often escalate into a complete panic attack, I can actually control my thoughts and processing.

I’ve also been working closely with a therapist to address this issue, but with the lack of mental anxiety, it’s really difficult to navigate and find reason. With all this drive and mental clarity finally feeling like I can move forward in life, I’m so eager to treat this isolated issue.

After a discussion with my ADHD clinician, she supported me asking my GP for a propranolol prescription. From conducting my own research, everything about propranolol aligns and looks promising for finally providing relief. I just have to hope the GP agrees when I speak to her on Thursday.

Does anyone else have experience with propranolol for physical anxiety? I’m based in the UK, and not entirely sure how reluctant they can be. I also don’t have low blood pressure or resting heart rate.",14-09-2025 16:05,11,3

So basically the semester started a little less than a month ago and I have been very stressed. My dad got diagnosed with cancer in his bladder and has been in hospital for over a week now.

I just had my exam today and it went horribly. I most likely failed the exam completely. I've been reading so much recently but nothing seems to stick. I don't know if it's because of stress or anxiety but it sucks. 

My dad had to have another emergency surgery two days ago and has a fever now. For reference, my parents live on the other side of the country but I took a plane a week ago to my parents house to watch the dog while they were in the hospital (the hospital is 4 hours away from may parents house since they live very rural). I took the plane back yesterday to take the exam. I haven't been able to go to any of the lectures because of this.

I have been so scared and so stressed and anxious and now I'm super depressed about how terrible I did on the exam. I got a lot of the questions wrong even though I actually know the answer.

I don't know what's wrong with me but I'm so incredibly ashamed and embarrassed. The examiner doesn't know everything about my life and will probably just think I'm super dumb and stupid even though I read a lot and care a lot too.

And then that jolt of anxiety kicks in...I've had to pull over on the highway this summer cause I had this happen and it scared the shit out of me.

Today, I was in the middle of reading a report to the on-coming shift and I suddenly started focusing too much on the sound of my voice and the slightly odd rhythm that the reports are usually written in. And I couldnt stop it, and completely spiraled. I suddenly felt like i couldnt read, even though I was still saying words, my voice started shaking, I could barely get words out, I had a million anxious thoughts going in my head... I tried covering it up by pretending to have a cough stuck in my throat until I was finished reading. Which im shocked i was able to do cause I really thought I was about run out of there in embarrassment. This report reading usually takes 5-10 minutes to complete, and i normally enjoy doing it.

And as soon as I was finished, it went away. And I will have to read the report tomorrow too but im already getting anxious about it because what if this happens again tomorrow?? I can ask someone else to read for me tomorrow, but not every time now...

I started Wellbutrin this past spring, and i know it can increase anxiety, but I would expect to have noticed sooner if this was a side effect from it. I really hope its not from the wellbutrin.

I dunno what im asking for here... I really just need to get this off my chest, but suggestions, or support is welcome. I feel embarrassed about what happened today and I dont know how to manage this going forward.",07-09-2025 06:53,10,8

About a year ago I had a bit of an anxiety issue for a month or so. Multiple factors combined at a very inconvenient time and I got in the anxiety loop, where the anxiety makes you feel weird and feeling weird makes you anxious. 

During this time, I stopped drinking coffee and soda, opting instead for tea. I noticed the coffee and soda made me jittery and anxious. That, along with many other things I did to try and reduce the factors involved allowed me to slowly get back to normal. Within a month or so of drinking tea, I managed to get back to drinking soda regularly without it messing with me or making me physically jittery.

Recently, over the last few weeks, I noticed that even if I have a soda with a meal, it makes me kind of shaky again. I don't get anxious about it, I'm not particularly thrown off by it, but the light physical shaking and feeling ""on edge"" is there. I switched back to tea again. 

Anyone else ever have anything similar happen? Think it might just be in my head? The odd part to me is that I was fine for 8 or so months drinking soda regularly, then, now, for no particular reason, it's impacting me again.",04-09-2025 23:41,8,7

I drove for 12 hrs last week. No panic attack, no health issues. 

I spent 10 days in a country 1000km away from my house

Today i had a free day. I spent three hours sat at my pc with nobody around. I spent an hour at a park, by myself. And now i’ve been on the couch for the past two hours with my gf. I spent so many consecutive hours in the same spots, but tomorrow i have a flight, a RIDICULOUSLY short flight, 1.5 hrs, and i’m on the verge of cancelling. What the fuck is wrong with me, what does it matter if i’m on a plane surrounded by people and FAs trained in CPR etc or alone at home? 

Why am i okay with driving for 12 hours a car, which is exponentially more dangerous than flying, but as soon as someone mentions flying, my rational mind just fucks off? 

It makes no sense, the plane ride is short and painless, driving for 12 hours is long, dangerous and tiring. Not to mention i drove on stretches of highway that were 250+ miles with NOTHING around like really nothing, just open fields. And that didn’t give me panic attacks but just thinking of a 1.5h plane ride is sending me to anxiety town?

She has early stages of COPD. Every time I see her, she seems like she's sick or she's just getting over some sickness.

She also had been a life long smoker but actually had finally quit several months before her death. She had been having trouble breathing and they found out that she had lung cancer. She was going to start treatment, when one day she was having a hard time breathing, went into respiratory arrest, and died. It was less than a month from her diagnosis to her death. 

My mom doesn't really seem to take good care of herself either. She's not obese or anything, but she just doesn't seem to care. It's like she's just floating through life listless until someone pokes her and she has to come back to reality temporarily.

It feels as if I’m going to faint or start seizing out when the anxiety is at its peak. Yesterday however felt very different. I felt very bad yesterday before bed so I checked my blood preassure. It was very low reading 88/53. I started stressing out and took some electrolytes in hopes of getting it normal. But for hours it kept being at low numbers: 88/53, 90/56, 93/59, 80/53… etc. That made me panic even more. I couldn’t sleep for hours in fear of dying in my sleep. Then at 5 am it suddenly hitted me. I had a glimpse in a mirror and I felt my face dropping and numbness and tingling all over my body. I was so sure I was having a stroke so I called the ER. It was gone when I called the ambulance. They looked at me from the phone and made sure I didn’t have anything urgent and told me I looked fine. I still can’t let off the feeling something is wrong because I still keep feeling bad at points of the day. Anybody else felt like this with their anxiety? Or could it be not anxiety related after all. What to do…",06-09-2025 18:02,9,5

Anxiety has always been a big part of my life. Even the simplest situations have often felt overwhelming and filled with fear. About four years ago, I started psychotherapy and soon after began medication (Sereupin). Unfortunately, it didn’t help much, so I switched to Zoloft, which wasn’t very effective either.

In May, I tried to challenge myself with an internship. I only lasted two days before I had to quit because of intense fear and panic attacks at work.

Now I’m on Citalopram and have been taking the full dose for about two weeks. I recently tried another internship, but again, after two days of panic and crying, I had to give it up.

At this point, I feel terrified at the idea of trying again. I’m afraid I’ll never be able to enter the workforce, become financially independent, participate in society as a “healthy” individual, and most importantly, recover.

With this post, I’m hoping to connect with people who have gone through something similar, people who can reassure me and help me believe that recovery is possible. Thank you.",06-09-2025 14:49,9,3

However, over the course of the year 2024 I began to get better and made a lot of progress via exposure therapy. I documented some of my wins on my profile. I managed to return to university and I powered through my final year and I’m due to graduate in a month with an amazing grade! I’ve been on many successful outings in the city with friends and I finally feel like a functioning member of society again.

However, one things that has continued to affect me is anticipatory anxiety. Before I leave the house I always feel a deep sense of dread and impending doom. Some days are a lot worse than others. Sometimes I’ll begin to feel anxious the night before an outing. The main difference now compared to a year ago is that I never let it get the best of me, I still go out anyway and everything ends up being fine after a while. It still kind of bothers me a little bit and I really want to go back to the old version of myself that was able to easily leave the house without any doubts or worries whatsoever.

Most of my anxiety in the 20 years since then has been me worrying about having panic attacks, which spirals badly at times, and over analyzing every sensation in my body. I always think it's my heart. I've been to the ER twice (20ish years ago), called an ambulance to my house once (8 years ago), and yesterday had the EMT at my work check me out. I've done more EKG's than I can remember and got a clean bill of health from a cardiologist after a stress test echo 15 years ago. At that time I was waking up to panic attacks with my heart racing every single night. 

  
That cardiologist gave me an RX for a low dose of klonopin, which, along with the stress test results, helped immensely. For a while.

  
The worst panic attack I had was in 2017. Combination of stress from an awful divorce and taking an edible that was way too strong for me. 8 hours of my pulse at or above 150. I hadn't experience the ""couch glue"" thing before, so crawling across the house to get to the door and outside to meet the EMT's was certainly an experience.

  
I've been feeling pretty crappy for the past month, at least. Maybe longer. Chest has been tight for the past two weeks. I started falling into old habits. Checking my blood pressure way too frequently. Checking my pulse constantly. There's some reassurance there, but it makes me so hyperfocused on every sensation in my chest. I'd basically given up on working out because the sensation of my heart doing its thing was just amping me up every time. 

Yesterday, about 6 hours into my work day, I got the 'ol sense of impending doom. Heart started racing. Checked my pulse and it was over 150 and climbing. Topped out at 171 before the battery on my oximeter died. Had my boss call the EMT because, per usual, I thought I was dying. 

Pulse started dropping pretty much as soon as I knew the EMT was on the way. 120 by the time she got to my area and back below 100 in minutes. 

What really helped me last night was reading other people's accounts on here. I've been through it so many times but knowing that so many other people have experienced the exact same thing really helped. My chest didn't really stop feeling tight until I was chilling at my partner's apartment reading hours later. Still feels better today, though.

I know I need to drop weight and get back to regular exercise. It's helped every time in the past. 

I know if I just give in and say ""f it, bring it on"" when I feel anxiety creeping in, it works for me 90% of the time. Yesterday just hit before I could do any grounding or anything to mitigate it. 

If anyone would like to talk about it, I'd welcome it. Mostly this is paying it forward for how much reading other's accounts helped me yesterday and I hope this helps someone else in the future.

Lately, I’ve noticed a pattern that’s really wearing me down: I’m constantly scanning myself. Every situation, every activity, my mind asks:
	•	“Am I enjoying this?”
	•	“Do I feel present right now?”
	•	“Why don’t I feel how I think I should feel?”

It’s like an inner critic combined with a 24/7 status check. Instead of living the moment, I’m monitoring whether I’m living the moment. It kills spontaneity, creates pressure, and makes everything feel artificial.

Has anyone else experienced this?
	•	How did you stop the endless self-checking?
	•	Any practical tips that actually work?
	•	Does this fade over time if you ignore it, or does it need a conscious strategy?

I’d really appreciate hearing from anyone who’s been through this and found a way to quiet that inner scanner.

anxiety,1mv7xt7,deleted,deleted,5 years of derealization  – looking for experiences and coping tips,"Hi everyone, I’m an 18-year-old Finnish boy and I wanted to share my story and ask if anyone else has gone through something similar.

Back in elementary school I was bullied, and that’s when I developed OCD. The symptoms stayed with me for years, even up until this year (though much milder). I’m now in my last year of high school (3rd year), and I’ve actually managed to cut off most of the OCD – mainly because I realized I need to reduce unnecessary sources of stress if I want to recover from derealization.

During my first and second year of high school I felt a lot of guilt. I was constantly worrying whether I had hurt someone with something I said, or if I had offended random people without noticing. Some people even triggered that fear in me, and I spent so much time overthinking that it felt like literal pressure in my head. Now, in my 3rd year, those OCD and guilt feelings are mostly gone, and I try not to care too much about what others think of me, because my main focus is overcoming derealization.

Back when I was younger, I used to feel sick or anxious if I had to go somewhere – for example, going to church or other events. In middle school, it mostly happened at school. One trigger was when my only friend wasn’t at school. I’d go to class and then leave after a little while because I felt like I might throw up, and it would usually pass once I got home. Later, I forced myself to go to school with a friend when they were there, and gradually learned to get over it.

I remember a specific moment in 7th grade winter when I was playing on the computer. I suddenly noticed the derealization feeling and panicked. **That panic didn’t help at all – and it never really does**. Even now, I feel much better because **I no longer fear or panic about it.**

Even now, in my final year of high school, my derealization still comes in waves—sometimes more intense, sometimes milder. It’s still present, but its intensity changes, and even the weather can affect it

Sometimes if there are lots of people in a hallway, I might think, “what if I collapse on the floor?” That thought itself makes me feel lightheaded. I’ve noticed that constant fear of derealization, exaggerating it, and overthinking actually worsens it. Even though it can feel absolutely hellish at times, **I truly believe that fear and overthinking make it worse**. **Our own thoughts can hurt us in many ways. My school psychologist also reassured me that I’m not the only one who suffers from this.**

I’ve been seeing a school psychologist. I told them about my OCD and guilt issues, and recently explained that I’ve managed to cut them off almost completely. I’ve also talked about grounding techniques, which sometimes help – for example, when I remind myself “I am here, right now,” I can feel present again, but it usually only lasts a few seconds.

The feeling itself is very hard to describe. It’s like living in a fog, or like being stuck in a dream. Sometimes it feels as if my nose is clogged and should “open up” any moment, or like there’s water in my ears that needs to drain. **I’ve noticed that belief and willpower really matter – believing that I** ***can*** **recover from derealization helps me keep going**. And I know derealization is the brain’s way of protecting itself from overwhelming stress or trauma, by creating this unreal feeling. **The fact is: derealization is always temporary, never permanent.**

I’ve overcome other struggles before. OCD is basically gone (only tiny traces every now and then), and I used to suffer from nausea for years when I had to go somewhere – but I’ve gotten over that too. So I know it’s possible to get through this.

Even though I still struggle with derealization, I can still live normally, react to situations, and keep up with life. I even passed my driving test on the first try recently, which felt like a huge achievement for me.

Has anyone else dealt with derealization this long? How do you cope with it when it flares up? I would like to hear some healing stories from derealization and stuff

Edit: On August 7th, 2025, almost two weeks ago, while on the school yard, a friend mentioned, as we were leaving for home, that he knew it was me who had asked a question on our high school Jodel:

*""Does anyone feel unreal/dreamlike/absent?""*

I had asked him about this the day before, referring to my own experiences with derealization. When he said that, I felt a small rush of embarrassment or self-consciousness, and it somehow grounded me—like it brought my feet back to the ground. Later, we drove together to a nearby store, and from there I walked home. During the walk and once I got home, I felt an incredibly realistic, vivid sense of being present. Everything felt more “real” than usual. I remember feeling truly happy and even told my mom and dad how normal I felt. I was overwhelmed with joy. I’d estimate my derealization was only 10–20% or barely noticeable. To me, this felt like a clear sign of improvement and a reminder that recovery is possible, even after years of chronic symptoms.",20-08-2025 07:16,9,1

I didn't even believe in Anxiety before, I didn't even think Anxiety could cause physical symptoms.

I'd like to start off by saying that this Is one VERY hard trial that we must all face, and that I wish strength for all those going through this journey.

I'm 27 Years old, Male, Quite healthy. Don't smoke, drink on occasion, very active in Racing Motorcycles, Martial Arts and Generally fitness and gym overall. Both of my parents, and some of my aunts have been diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder. Mother and Father are quite overweight but healthy nonetheless.

It all Started last May 13, 2025 when I was just in the gym, drank my pre workout then got going. An hour after I finished, had the weirdest feeling that i was going to die, left side of face felt numb even when I knew it wasn't? (Could still touch it.) Heart raced then of course, mother drove me to the hospital, and behold, Everything was clear ECG, Bloodwork all clear.

I was sent home then I thought wow what a panic attack, then that night I had some of the scariest feelings, I had this pressure in my Head coming from my neck that was weird to describe, it felt like someone was pulling my spine and that someone was inflating something in my head. 

The next day It still persists, then I decide to get a CT-Angiogram (The one with the Ink) of course everything was clear, One of my biggest fears was to die of Aneurism or anything like that so I cried when I got the result. After I was sent home the pressure wasn't going away, It's been here for weeks, months and even until today. It does get less but ever so little, couple that with some random palpitations, some random bouts of doom, some random bouts of a headache coupled with the head pressure and just the feeling of hopelessness.

It seems like Anxiety is tailor made for each and every one of us, to cling to us through our hardest fears, I always hated the Idea of having an Aneurism or Brain tumor so of course I get those symptoms of Head Pressure, Tingling, Sometimes lightheadedness ALL DAY. My Neck, Occipitals and Shoulders seem to spasm at random times as well which is prrobably the reason for the pressure but still. Pressure ven radiates behind my eyes at times.

And you know what Pisses me off? Is that Anxiety seems to mask or blur even our common sense. Even my doctors are reassuring my that a CT-A Scan is the gold standard for looking at Tumors and or Aneurism or anything serious and my brain STILL associates the pain with having that ""What if"" scenario. I even make 3 doctors look at my CT-A scan and all said the same thing. My Bp is normal, my weight is good, I don't smoke and I'm young and yet here I am spiralling about diseases which my doctors say I'm all cleared of. Worst part as well Is that It seems to to come in waves, you think you're good then Bam here goes those symptoms again hahaha. Doctors even told me I am very far from having any of those.

Funny part? When I have a really GOOD day like say, being really busy or happy with family or when I'm talking to pretty ladies (Yes, I said that right hahah) It's like the head pressure/Palpitations/Head tingling become GONE for those couple of moments, even days when I'm with a pretty girl or with my family and enjoying myself.

  
Talked to a Psychiatrist and of course, I wasn't surprised he diagnosed me with GAD. 

I hate the feeling of this all day head pressure/headache, the chest tightness, the face tingles, The feeling of doom or that I'm going to die any moment, the migraines, the constant doomscrolling on Dr. Google Etc. But It is what it is. I simply wanted to share my story and to let other people know that Anxiety symptoms may vary slightly on the main symptom they get. 

It's a tough journey everyone, but this is one of those things we must face. Another hard part is that some of us will have to come face these symptoms alone as I am blessed with family members and friends who have It as well but have come to help me. But don't worry, we have to come find those days of normalcy, those days like when I get to be with my family enjoy or be with pretty girls and feel normal. Then we understand we aren't broken, It's this thing in our mind that Is with us that we have to challenge.  
I've been a fighter all my life, but It seems like a battle with the mind is the toughest opponent we will have.

I'm 3 months in, slowly Improving and I hope you are all as well. God bless to all of us and we will make It. Trust your doctors, your family members (Mine have told me that It does get better, but It takes time and that It will be different for everyone, sometimes years.) 

Our purpose In life is to be defeated, by whatsoever enemy we have, Mine is with my mind. So let us be, then we can stand up and rise once more.

I wish you all the best. (Care to share some stories of your head pressure and tension headaches as well? Or any symptoms you may have.)",18-08-2025 11:26,8,14

If that makes sense? I forget the tiniest details, say things that don’t even make sense, and feel like I’m on the verge of tears the entire time. My mouth and lips get all dry, and I just feel like I’m making a fool out of myself. I have to remind myself to be intentional, to take deep breaths etc. but that rarely helps.

Sorry if the wording in the title is harsh, I just couldn’t think of another way to say it 🫠. I know that I’m not actually stupid, but whenever I experience that stuff, it makes me feel like I am.

I doubt that I’m alone on this, so does anyone who’s in the same boat have any tips that help them? And is there someone who’s gotten over these feelings fully? Thank you 🥲

So i have extreme death anxiety and for the past 4 days i have been in extreme panic and my head repeating materialistic approaches for the afterlife which is “nothingness” which i fear the MOST. 

I have been having symptoms like shaking, shortness of breath, nauseous, puking, burning sensation, not being able to eat, my head repeating “youll be in darkness forever” on LOOP like a curse.

Then finally today I had a panic attack where i just broke down crying and just kept shouting “I dont want to d1e” and “i dont want to sleep forever” then when we came home I was still not breathing properly and I had a EXTREME panic attack where I cried and screamed for a hour, hyperventilated to the point i couldnt keep my head up due to its heaviness and being dizzy, i couldnt even move my hands due to numbness and I couldnt even walk, I geniunely felt paralyzed.

Also my parents were stressed to the point my dad cried, i never saw him cry. And my mom begging me to calm down since i am so young and that there is zero evidence on nothingness and that they had spiritual experiences related to this and that I shouldnt worry.

I went to sleep and i woke up around 20 mins ago and all of the thoughts, the panic, the shortness of breath is back. Im still in this anxiety mode.

But even after my panic has lessened, I find myself living the same way. Avoiding triggers that I don't think exist anymore. Planning every outing around how I'll be able to get away to calm down. Avoiding things I seriously need to do in life to get better because I know they caused me panic in the past.

The feeling has just been bottled up inside of me, progressively building and building, sometimes coming out in outbursts where I can barely get a singular cohesive thought out to my partner. I am all over the board with what I want to do, but i know I just want to get out of my current job. Some sort of change. But coupled with me being usually too scared to take any steps I want for myself, I don't see much progress beyond a google search or asking chatgpt for a viable way out that won't result in burning every bridge I've built over the past few years. I think I've semi-settled on the plan of getting a job that offers evening shifts, just to have some more money in my pocket that could eventually be put towards getting another degree at a community college, or some sort of vocational school. 

I've started to go on walks around my town after work; it does a good job of clearing my head a bit, slowing things down, and just increasing my overall step count. My town has a lot of bars and restaurants, so I figured maybe I could just walk right into one and ask if they have any openings. My partner & I had recently talked about maybe me getting into bartending, as there's a handful of local bars that are walking distance from our place, and the idea that I am conventionally attractive enough and pleasant to interact with, where earning tips shouldn't come as an issue. I have no bartending experience whatsoever. I amped myself up to go into a popular bar in town and ask the bartender if they were looking for another set of hands... but I chickened out and walked right past the place. BUT, once I got around the block, I did find their phone number online and gave the place a call and asked. I was very nervous, I'm not sure if I asked the question correctly. I was put on with the owner and spoke with him for a few minutes. He told me to swing by anytime this week for a chat. I would've walked right back in there if he didn't sound like he was on his way out at that moment. I should've just walked in there from the jump, really. I think I would've made a better impression. I don't know. 

So in a few hours, after I'm out of work, I'm gonna take that walk into town and see what happens! I am not expecting the world as I have no experience, but I am open to learning new skills, and if this place doesn't work out, I'll have plenty more to give a shot!

I've always struggled with anxiety (especially health anxiety) and emetophobia and it's just piling on top of each other. It's gotten to the point I get really bad DPDR at times. I'm a guy so I don't have many safe spaces to talk about this kind of stuff without feeling judged. I just want to enjoy my senior year without having to struggle to make it day-by-day.

It all started about a year ago when I got super high (one of my first times) and had a panic attack; I thought I was gonna throw up and kept trying but I wasn't able to. Ever since then, I've always had this weird feeling in my stomach (sometimes it goes away for a few days at a time) that just feels super uncomfortable. I struggle with nausea really bad too and it all just loops back into my anxiety (I get anxious about like anything lol). Recently, it's been so bad and I feel like I have to throw up all the time. I've even tried getting super high again and made it through a panic attack to try and break the loop (I thought maybe it was a mental block thing) and it helped to a point with my nausea but I stopped because my anxiety had me thinking I would get psychosis or something and it wasn't helping my derealization

It got to the point where I was having panic attacks falling asleep so I went to the Dr. and had an ultrasound and endoscopy done and they found nothing except that my sphincter was a bit loose. I was put on omeprazole for a little over 8 months before I decided to stop taking it (like two weeks ago). It may have helped a little? but I honestly couldn't really tell and I think it may have been making me more nauseous. After I stopped taking it I felt great for like two weeks, but I caught a cold a couple days ago and it brought back my acid reflux and it's been 10x worse lately. I woke up choking two nights ago and ever since then I've been so anxious and have had such bad acid reflux.

I work out and am fairly active and eat somewhat well I'd like to think (although the foods I eat don't usually seem to affect my acid reflux). Do you think it could be my anxiety making this worse? I've always had severe health anxiety and honestly just get super anxious about things in general. I've always been able to deal with the mental part and the sweaty fingers and racing heart but now that's it turned into physical symptoms I'm starting to lose it.

I got married back in July and the week after the wedding it started. I had originally chalked it up to having bad anxiety and it being very heightened in the time surrounding the wedding but then the blood persisted.

I had some blood in my stool in 2023 for a few months but the doctor noted it was likely a fissure or  hemorrhoids and it did go away and hadn’t come back until now. I finally got into a doctor today (no family doc) and they’re sending me for blood work, testing, and have again prescribed me a treatment as if it’s hemorrhoids. My main symptoms are the blood and discomfort in the rectal area. I’m trying to convince myself it’s just bad hemorrhoids because I have a sedentary desk job and am overweight (though I’ve lost 55lbs in the last 1.5 years with some major lifestyle changes). 

I’m reading so many folks with experience similar to mine that ended up being colon cancer and it’s causing me to freak out. My anxiety is through the roof. I can’t focus on anything else and it’s consuming me. Wondering if any others have similar experiences, advice for coping, or if anyone has gone through this process and has any advice.

Anyways, I have 7 bad molars, today they took out 3, I opted for laughing gas as I’ve never had it before and I’ve read it works great for anxious people, I laid in the chair and just breathed in the gas as deep as I could, for what felt like an hour before the dentist came in, it didn’t knock me out or make me unaware in any way, I was a bit giggly and relaxed but that’s it, he came in and numbed me up, I won’t lie that hurt a bit but it was expected as I’ve had it before several times, a needle is just gonna hurt plain and simple, but the extractions are what had me scared, it turns out I had no reason to be scared because I didn’t feel anything but pressure, it was kinda intense during the actual extractions but literally no pain whatsoever, the worst of it was the sounds of teeth breaking loose, that shook me a little mentally but I’m not kidding he pulled all 3 teeth in a matter of 5 minutes tops, making me happy that I was done for the day. If you’re struggling with fear and anxiety over teeth extractions, please don’t. Im the world’s worst and I made it out fine and with minimal pain. It’s now about 3 hours post extraction and really I just wanna sleep, I’m not hurting just a little sore. Gotta go back in two weeks to have another wisdom removed, and I honestly may not pay for the gas again because I feel it didn’t do a whole lot but relax me and made my mouth tingle and a little numb.

There will definitely be some triggering stuff as I’m wanting to describe my anxiety. 


This is unbearable and I honestly believe that my depression is because of my anxiety. I feel INCOMPATIBLE with life. 

The racing heart, elephant on my chest, heart palpitations, constantly monitoring every little sensation in my body. Can’t feel my heart pounding out of my chest? Oh must be something wrong, gotta panic now. Heart pounding out of my chest? Oh it’ll never stop and only get faster and then I’m gonna go into cardiac arrest and die. Weird sensation in my stomach? Must be my appendix rupturing and I’m gonna be too scared to go to the hospital and die. Slept on my arm weird so now it hurts? Probably arm pain caused by HEART ATTACK. I feel like my body isn’t actually mine most the time or like I’m not real. That I’ll never get it to calm down. And with every panic attack I’m convinced I’m going to die. Someone rubs my skin the wrong way, I touch something weirdly textured, or my feet get dry and touch and I’m FREAKING OUT. 

It never stops. Lights are too bright, everything is too loud. People looking at me makes me extremely uncomfortable. I’m a sahm so i keep myself in the house as much as humanly possible- I’m talking I can go weeks without leaving and just have my partner take the kids out so they actually get to enjoy life. Me? My bed is my bestfriend, under the covers, watching movies, trying not to panic or dissociate. I clean and cook, play with the kids but every little moment between is me hiding away from the world. 

I rock back and forth, I’ve even sucked my thumb like I did as a child, hide under my pillow, dumped ice cold water on myself, paced. I got to a point once where I was open to medication after a bad experience, got on Prozac, TERRIBLE idea, it reset my progress and made my anxiety significantly worse and my HR was at like 160 constantly. I’m too scared to try again. 

I feel extremely depressed. I can’t walk long periods of time outside without feeling like my legs are gonna give up. I don’t want to pick things up because I feel my arms are gonna give up. I don’t want to eat because I’m scared I’ll go into anaphylactic shock and die so I have to wait 5mins after each bite when I try new foods. Huge phobia of doctors and hospitals. I’ve lost 20lbs. I only eat my safe foods. I never feel like I’ve closed a door right, or flushed the toilet right, or hm did I leave the oven that I haven’t touched in days on? Gotta go check a few times. 

Extreme obsessive thoughts about every negative interaction I’ve ever had. I isolate myself from other adults (or kids, except my own, really just people in general) hate going to the bathroom because I feel claustrophobic and like I can’t escape. Can’t go in a car without severe panic attacks because the same thing. I even hate the bath now which used to comfort me. 

Movies, tv shows, music, sometimes cleaning helps, ASMR, and good tea seems to help. A good nights sleep helps which I rarely get because I’m plagued by nightmares and my body jerks itself out of sleep a lot. I need any natural remedies or just any suggestions. 

I used to drink to cope, conversations were tolerable, rarely anxious, but from my severe trauma I was becoming suicidal and I have been sober for months and have no interest in picking that back up. 

I don’t drink coffee bc caffeine makes me extremely anxious but I do have a major nicotine addiction. 

Can’t smoke weed either because it’s always only ever given me panic attacks. Ugh. 

I’m exhausted all the time from constantly being on edge or panicking.

Before anyone says anything, this account was made 4 years ago because I created it to be able to view a post that answered a question I had back then.

I’ve always been an anxious person, ever since I was young I always remember having days where I struggled to breathe due to being in some panicked state. However as of recent times, I feel like those anxious feelings have blown out of proportion. I had my first blown panic attack around June, and ever since then I feel I’ve become so much more hyper aware of things like my breathing. My brain has felt like it’s been running on caffeine and I often wake up in a panic due to a fear that I’m about to die. Hell, I’m writing this post right now because I’ve been unable to sleep. My brain is so sure there’s an armed, dangerous individual at the hotel I’m staying at and it’s messing with me.

Anyway, these events are so common and are starting to happen more and more in every day. Some mornings I’ll wake up with a sure feeling that someone is hunting me, and when I do forget about it the thought slams back to me hours later, but in a worse way. The paranoia is driving me insane.

My anxiety seems to revolve around the fear of death, and it’s so consuming and tiring and I can’t escape it no matter what I do. I get this heavy pang in my chest and I just can’t take it anymore.

I’m sorry if my grammar is bad, and if I make no sense, I just really need to say something about this. I feel crazy, I don’t want to be crazy.",01-09-2025 06:36,7,3

When you are taking all this action to try and stop your anxiety you are doing nothing but reinforcing the idea that anxiety is actually something to fear.

The best thing to do is move towards it, sit with it calmly, let it happen, let the thoughts pass, let the sensations happen. When you do this enough you learn that it is all nothing to fear. It really reshapes the way you see yourself and anxiety for the better.

Not anywhere far, but out of my apartment. I got to where I can’t leave the apartment for anything but work, which adds to my stress levels so much that I keep having panic attack. But while I can’t leave the apartment, I also feel trapped here. It’s small, it’s cramped, it has gas which terrifies me. It has a bunch of issues, including leaks that just keep coming up. I can’t take it anymore. I’m always on edge listening for water and have to keep checking the oven over and over to make sure it’s turned off, even if I hadn’t used it. I haven’t slept well in months because all I ever hear is the upstairs neighbors fighting and every step they take they have to stomp as loud as they possibly can. They also have an extremely large and extremely loud dog who barks all day and night.

Me and my partner went and looked at a house for rent today just for the hell of it, and while inside the house I felt calm for the first time in months. I could move more than 5 steps without entering another room. I felt like I could breathe. It was cooler in every single room even though the temperature was set higher than what I keep my apartment. There were no people above me constantly screaming at each other and stomping around non stop. It was just an amazing feeling that I have never felt in my apartment.

So we applied for it and one other house we looked at that I also really liked. We’ve decided to break our lease so I can finally relax. The rent is more expensive but we can afford it. I just don’t think I’m ever going to get better if I stay in this apartment.",28-08-2025 23:45,8,2

I have been stressed my whole life and I have felt the stress almost every day, no matter what I did.  
I am almost 40.   
  
Now, after a month of vertigo, migraines, weird headaches, brain fog, mild nausea, throwing up, after I have seen many doctors and an ENT, I got the diagnosis that it's most likely my anxiety that's causing all of this. Nothing neurological was found. But at the same time, like, I cannot go out, I cannot see my friends, I cannot enjoy anything, any of the few things at least that I still want to do and still make me a little bit happy.   
  
Like, I go to work and I don't feel okay, I feel like something is pulling from my head and can barely manage even with taking painkillers every day.   
  
How do I accept the fact that just stress is the cause?   
  
How do I stop myself worrying that it's something more serious? How do I handle this long term? Do I need to stop working for some time? What if I start antidepressants to reduce my anxiety but they cause me more nausea/brain fog and instead of better I am worse?  
  
please give me any tips and tricks and anything you could suggest that maybe has helped you.

I have severe anxious attachment. I have been in my relationship now for 17 months. When I say that I love this man with my whole heart, I mean it. He is a fantastic partner and we align so much. I can see a future with him.

However, my anxious thinking and triggers are just ruining everything. He legit told me to stop acting 'crazy' and to be fair... yeah I can be crazy when we disagree, especially over messages. Say if we are having an 'argument' (I wouldn't call it that as we don't yell or get angry, we just don't see eye to eye and bicker) and he says something that would trigger my mind to think he is going to leave me, I will message as much as I can for him to respond and will try to call him... okay look I know, it's bad, i'm just freaking the fuck out. I am in therapy yes. I have also started seeing an anxiety counsellor too and this has been slowly helping me with some more calming techniques.

When we do hang out, if I notice the slightest difference in his tone or body language, my mind starts to find reasons why he doesn't love me and I try and reassurance seek. When I sleepover, I find the mornings the hardest as he likes to sit on his phone and slowly wake up for the day, sure there is some chatting but I find this so fucking hard.. it feels like he is ignoring me, I cannot just sit there on my phone. I try to do some uni work or read, but I am so fucking anxious. I just get stuck in freeze and I will try and nitpick. I really sound crazy I do, I just cannot handle it. I have started to leave and go to the gym as that does help too, but I am funny with time and if things aren't done by certain times.. then well, I can't do it and then the day has been wasted if things are pushed out.. and he loves a sleep in until 9 whereas I would have gone to the gym by 9am.. does this even make any sense?

I just want to feel loved because at the moment I don't feel loved by him and he has said that this will push him away. I sound really crazy I know, I am just struggling so much. I am in the biggest fear he will leave. I have been abandoned so much. I am a very very giving person, I put in so much effort, I will do anything for anyone. Anytime I feel like certain things aren't being met, I shut down and become so anxious and so upset I feel like I am so unloveable with all this shit. I just don't want to lose him, he really is the best thing I have in my life.

My psychologist believes that all my focus is on my relationship and I need other connections, which yeah, okay I understand. I don't have friends really, I did move schools quite a bit so that made it challenging. Also, I am not a drinker or partier (anxiety and hate the taste of alcohol) so that has made it a challenge.

Some of the behaviours I do (that he isn't aware about): 

I will constantly check to see if he has messaged or if he is active (even with active sign off!)

If i don't hear back in a timely matter, I start to get super anxious and thing what if this, what if that 

If he seems to not be putting in heaps of 'effort' in his messages, I catastrophize in my head 

I overthink problems that aren't there

Any advice for those who have experienced this? What can I do to change this way of thinking? How the fuck do I stay calm?

Thank you.",10-09-2025 23:28,8,4

I have always been terrified of bats, for obvious reasons.

In mid july, i woke up to a bite mark on my arm, and i have been having the worst intrusive thoughts since then. I know rabies in the US is really rare, but my brain still thinks that a bat somehow got in my room while i was asleep, and bit me, and escaped.

i do have an AC in my window, but it is sealed, and no bat is getting through that unless it was some super bat.

i checked my room for one, and haven’t found one, but i noticed there was a hole underneath my base heater, and i freaked even more, because what if it actually escaped?

I know that, that possibly is slim, but like i said earlier in my post, my mind is still saying “Hey! you were bitten by a bat last night!” and that i am gonna start showing symptoms soon.

Pulse thundering in my ears. Sometimes, it feels like my heart stops in my chest, and I get instantly lightheaded, and then my heart slams back into gear and takes my breath away.

I regret ever telling the doctors I have anxiety.

I've called the paramedics three times. Every time they come to the house, they tell me to take a bath. Do some breathing. Sit and watch a TV show. One paramedic even told me to ""rub one out."" I don't have health insurance, but I went to the ER one day after picking my son up from school because I was getting dizzy behind the wheel of the car. My blood pressure was 156 over 103, resting pulse of 100. The ER ruled out heart attack, stroke, and a clot in my lungs. Gave me two Ativan and said, 'peace out.'

I booked a cardiology appointment, after I booked myself a PCP, who stuck me on a basic blood pressure medication and asked me a lot of questions about my anxiety. Not about much else. The cardiologist put me on a Zio holter monitor for 7 days. I'm terrified he's just gonna call me back and say, ""everything is good, medicate your anxiety',"" when I literally just had another heart stopping spell last night that made me so wobbly on my that my dad had to reach out and  catch me.

Everything is uncomfortable. I feel like I can't take a full breath. Sometimes I have a double pulse in my neck. I only feel better when I lay down flat. I'm miserable after I eat.

My life changed 3 weeks ago. 

And I wish I would have never told anyone that I was an anxious person.

I wish I had someone to cry with. So, if you need a good cry today, cry with me.

Because I've been crying for three straight weeks. And I will cry again tonight as I fall asleep.

I’ve had panic attacks since I was 5 years old. For a really long time, I was never able to remember when or why it started. I developed emetophobia at that age and also agoraphobia over time after having panic attacks for almost 10 years before I got diagnosed and treated. I still struggle with those two triggers but it’s gotten better. However, I was never able to identify a single traumatic event that started all of it despite knowing deep down that something happened.

About two years ago I was having a conversation with my mom about a dream I had as a kid. I told her how we had been visiting my grandmother like we often did once a year, and we were driving back to the airport. The dream was very fuzzy. I remember lying down in the car seat, fixated on the gray sky outside the window. Then I remember my grandmother sitting next to me in the airport, and taking me to the bathroom. Two older ladies commented on how sick I looked. My grandmother told them I wasn’t feeling well and they shared some sympathy. I don’t know why this dream stuck with me. Everything about it was so fuzzy and surreal, like when you’ve just woken up and can’t remember all the details of a dream except for some odd visuals and a general idea of what occurred. I don’t know why I was compelled to tell my mom about this dream, but she told me that it hadn’t been a dream and when I was 4 or 5 years old I had gotten a horrible stomach bug on the morning we traveled back home from the grandmother’s house. She told me that I had begun to feel sick before we left and vomited for the whole 3 hour car ride. I think I can remember that beginning part, because I recall my grandmother giving me Alka Seltzer and me telling her it didn’t help my stomach ache. I remember that somewhat clearly. Everything else is a blur. I don’t remember the car ride at all, except for that one moment when I’m looking up at the sky. My grandma did sit in the airport with me and take me to the bathroom. Those old ladies were real. It was all real. My memory becomes clearer once we boarded the plane and I think I remember being given a barf bag although I had stopped throwing up by then. But these memories of what happened before and after, I’ve never associated with my “dream” memory because they actually felt real.

I remember being shocked because I couldn’t believe how something I had thought was a dream my whole life actually happened. I think deep down I knew. A little part of me knew it was real and that was why I asked, because it wanted the rest of me to know. But still to this day I’m confounded by how my brain was able to completely delete the traumatic experience from my memory and make the events that immediately followed seem surreal. Since then I have wondered if knowing that this was probably THE traumatic experience that began everything (though I’ve had many experiences that have compounded the anxiety) is in any way useful to my treatment. What do I do with knowing this actually happened? Does it mean anything? Is it even helpful to put traumatic events in focus for anxiety treatment or do I just… move on?

I’d really love to hear thoughts from others about how/if knowing of critical traumas are important to treatment for anxiety. ",06-09-2025 18:48,7,6

It caused some damage to my enamel that further aggravated my anxiety, and I’m having panic attacks because I can’t see my dentist soon enough to solve the problem before it get worse.)

(Sorry about the long post.)

I recently started to get TMJ disorder, probably due to stress, and massive anxiety about my teeth health due to not going to the dentist for nine years (I couldn’t afford it.) My anxiety only got better a few weeks ago after finally seeing a dentist, who assured me me that only my impacted wisdom teeth had cavities and needed to be extracted, and getting an appointment with a top surgeon to get it done.

But then, last week, my surgeon informed me that he’ll only be able to remove my crowns, and that it’s a risky, painful operation with chances of infection. This, along with some bad news I got, brought back my TMJ symptoms, but worse. I’ve been clenching my jaws non-stop since, and started grinding my teeth so hard that it woke me up one night and I chipped my enamel on one tooth (I‘ve never did that before.) I had to get it polished at an emergency clinic, and the dentist said she could see grinding marks on my teeth (after only three days!) I’m worried sick since, I can barely sleep, I‘m afraid to eat, too aware of the consequences of bruxism.

I know I should go to my regular dental cabinet, get a custom nightguard and a plan to ease my jaw symptoms. This would immensely decrease my anxiety and my teeth problems. But they are closed until September 15, I got my crown removal in six days, and the recovery time is two weeks minimum (if it’s not infected!)

I got a temporary nightguard on Amazon, but I‘m not sure how much it’s helping. My life has become a nightmare: I can’t help but notice how much the feeling has changed when I eat or speak, I‘m hyper-vigilant about every little difference (real or perceived) in my enamel and gums since last week, and it fuels my anxiety like never before. I can’t stop thinking about my teeth all the time, terrified that I might be damaging them by the days, if not the hours. I have racing thoughts about how I might need crowns, gum transplant, or other treatments I can’t afford in the near future, and it gives me panic attacks. Then I go read about my symptoms, making things worse, and I’ve lost track of how serious my problem is, what’s real and what’s imaginary. I feel like I’m blindly walking around a vicious circle, not knowing where am I and what is causing what. (Has anyone ever felt the same?)

I‘m tired; I just want to stop panicking and damaging my teeth and be reassured. :(",05-09-2025 03:24,8,7

I was on Zoloft for at least 8 years. Since April 2025 I’ve been weaning some sort of way. At first it was a faster taper with the intent to cross taper to Lexapro but that did not work out and it’s been hell since then. Tried to go back on Zoloft because at the time didn’t fully have answers of why I developed a movement disorder but I developed even worse side effects after trying to go back. 

I’ve had an arrangement of withdrawal symptoms and most I can directly relate to withdrawal but there is one symptom that is scaring this shit out of me. 

I will all of the sudden get this “drop” feeling. Like the floor had dropped from under me or an elevator drop. It typically starts as a weird head / body feeling with extreme off balance feeling / faint feeling. I had one two days ago while I was just standing in my office but this time I felt a “pulling down” feeling in my chest. 

It’s so hard to just “brush” these episodes off or chalk it up to anxiety state or withdraw. 


Has anyone experienced anything similar ? 

I’m pretty desperate to feel better at this point.

Is mostly because I have multiple conditions such as Asthma, Adrenal insuficiency and HyperIGE and they keep me on the edge.  
  
However, I've been having this feeling of ""poisoned-like"" as if I drank poison, like if I had a fever without having it, like if I had dirty water in my blood, it comes and goes every day and is been a year now. It forces me to stop my daily life and just lay.  
  
Most of my doctors just tells is anxiety but it feels too physical to me, they even gave me alprazolam. Does anyone know if what I describe indeed sounds like anxiety?

I found this reddit and thought asking people who is familiar with this condition could give me an idea of whats going on, as I worry is something my doctors are ignoring.

Thanks in advance.",04-09-2025 08:52,6,4

I tried going to a therapist for a few months. No shade but the 54321 stuff is not cutting it. I didn’t want to have to take medication but I need immediate relief.

The only options I know of are to get a prescription from a doctor or buying CBD. Which of these should I try first? Or are there other options I should consider?

Any advice would be appreciated.",03-09-2025 18:52,7,40

I for long time always felt a certain feeling of unease each time I remembered I'm a living person whose body does hundreds of tasks per minute to simply continue existing, but for some reason, for the last maybe 2 weeks, each time I remember that, I start to feel uncomfortable to the point of a mild anxiety.


I feel really uncomfortable understanding I have hundreds of organs in me, with each and everyone of them always working and fulfilling it's action.

I've never had any serious injuries, or a history of poor mental health, so I have no idea from where does this anxiety come.
